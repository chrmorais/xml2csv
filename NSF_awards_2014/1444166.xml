    <AbstractNarration>US-Korea Workshop on Security and Privacy for Internet of Things&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the organization of an exploratory workshop on establishing research collaborations between George Washington University (GWU) and Korean researchers in Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA) and Seoul National University (SNU) on the emerging area of security and privacy for Internet of Things (IoT). IoT security and privacy is a topic that cuts across many facets of the society, from agriculture to transportation to health-care. Thanks to the unique IoT testbeds built by Korean researchers, this proposed workshop has the potential to foster substantial opportunities for future research collaborations that may lead to fundamental research breakthroughs in IoT security and privacy. These breakthroughs can bring about research and educational impacts with international reach. The project will also have significant educational impacts on undergraduate and graduate students from the US, especially GWU students who are involved in the study-abroad program in Korea University, Seoul, Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is expected to bring together synergized research expertise from the following two groups of researchers: (i) US researchers with extensive experience on foundational security and privacy issues related to IoT. (ii) Korean researchers who are excellent partners for the proposed workshop and the subsequent planned collaborations. Compared with other countries, the research of IoT technologies has seen much faster growth and adoption in Korea, provided a larger amount of funding, and accomplished better and more advanced results. The workshop brings US researchers to Korea so they can visit the Korean IOT testbeds and discuss with their Korean counterparts about both visions and concrete (technical) plans for future collaborations, which can in turn help realize major research impacts and pave the way to a successful realistic deployment of large-scale IoT system with proper security and privacy protection. Understanding the security and privacy issues in IoT and realizing the ideas in a practical system constitute a strong intellectual research endeavor.</AbstractNarration>
