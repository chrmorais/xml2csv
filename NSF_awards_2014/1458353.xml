    <AbstractNarration>The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Connections project at Lewis University will contribute well prepared graduates to the STEM workforce with advanced training in chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and chemical physics. It is designed to enhance physical sciences education through an experiential learning model based on real-world experiences. The scholars will be provided with a solid foundation for employment and graduate school in a competitive landscape. Specific emphasis will be placed on skills relevant to pressing societal issues, such as alternative energy, novel materials for information storage, next generation health care materials, and advanced optical technology. The college will leverage its relationships with nanotechnology companies, Argonne and Fermi National Laboratories, and the community to provide students with experiential learning opportunities. It will also expand its research collaborations with the labs and both domestic and international companies working in these advanced fields. Outreach and recruitment strategies will focus on academically qualified students from minority populations and thereby contribute to the diversity of the STEM workforce. The university will pilot several enhancements to its physical science programs through STEM Connections, providing evidence to support future expansion throughout the physical science programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEM Connections will prepare students for physical science careers through an innovative process that emphasizes interdisciplinary connections in the context of real-world problem solving and workforce requirements. A special focus will be placed on interdisciplinary fields such as nanotechnology, materials science, and alternative energy. Connections will be strengthened among scholars to improve peer support and retention, and between students/faculty and outside institutions to improve engagement. STEM Connection will develop student understanding of interdisciplinary science, research methods, and how to apply science to real-world problems, as well as necessary skills in critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. An external evaluation will determine the impact of these strategies on enrollment, retention, graduation, and engagement. Extensive faculty and administrative support, up-to-date facilities, and a redesigned science curriculum will provide the resources to enable the university to accomplish its program objectives. Recruitment strategies will include using student and alumni networks, web-based marketing, and an on-campus mini-expo to connect with area high school students and their parents, teachers, and guidance counselors. Scholars will be supported financially through scholarships, and academically through first-year project-based experiences and foundational coursework linked to problem solving in industry and the community.</AbstractNarration>
