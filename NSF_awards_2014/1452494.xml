    <AbstractNarration>There is increasing interest in the Internet-­of­ Things where small computing devices are embedded in everyday objects and environments. A key issue is how to power these devices as they become smaller and numerous; batteries add bulk, cost, and require recharging that is difficult at large scale. This project proposes to design battery-free devices that can connect to the Internet using the WiFi networks around us. This proposed research is expected to create a pragmatic shift in the WiFi industry where in addition to providing connectivity to Wi­Fi device, routers can now tap into the RF­ powered device ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional low-­power Wi­Fi transceivers require much more power than is available from wireless signals, making it infeasible for RF-­powered devices to literally speak the WiFi protocol. The proposed research will produce algorithms, designs, circuits, and system implementations that will enable the first communication link between RF-powered devices and off the-shelf Wi­Fi devices, without the need to speak Wi­Fi. This project will develop a range of techniques from new low-­power analog codes to Wi­Fi rate adaptation algorithms to push the limits on our communication range and rate. The project will also design a complete network stack that enables multiple such devices to co-­exist and develop full-duplex capabilities on these battery-­free devices to significantly improve the power efficiencies of the resulting link-­ and network-­layer protocols. If successful, this project would create the critical component in the vision of RF-­powered Internet of things: an ability to connect billions of RF-­powered devices to existing Internet infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
