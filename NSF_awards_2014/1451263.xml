    <AbstractNarration>Funded by NSF's Research on Education and Learning (REAL) program, this early concept grant for exploratory research will develop a national research agenda. The ultimate goals of this research are to increase learning, diversity, and more effective use of technology, via the propagation of documented innovations throughout engineering education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address four major questions: (1) what accomplishments have been realized as a result of documented innovations to date? (2) To what extent have these innovations been propagated? (3) What remains to be done? &amp; (4) How best can future work be propagated? To address these questions the researchers will employ a number of interactive strategies involving both engineering education researchers and administrators. First, they will convene a planning committee of experts to identify individuals from engineering education who will be invited to participate in a Delphi study designed to identify key issues and needs for the next decade. Three writing teams, each addressing a critical area (learning in and out of the classroom, pipeline and diversity, and technology), will prepare white papers addressing questions (1) and (2). Versions of these papers will be presented at the 2015 American Society for Engineering Education Conference. Next, a cadre of invited participants will meet in early fall 2015 for a three day workshop to address questions (3) and (4). A draft of the final report will be available for comment from the engineering and engineering education community for 30 days before the final report in submitted.</AbstractNarration>
