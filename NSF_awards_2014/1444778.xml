    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Third Conference on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory, held at the University of Iowa on November 22-24, 2014. Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra studying symmetries in linear spaces. It interacts with many other areas in mathematics, mathematical physics, chemistry, and theoretical computer science. Geometric methods have become more and more fundamental in all of these areas. One of the main objectives of this conference is to introduce beginning researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. The keynote speaker for this conference will be Professor Gordana Todorov from Northeastern University who will give two one-hour lectures which will be accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. There will also be several expository lectures given by other well-known experts. The remainder of the lectures will be research talks given by both senior and junior mathematicians. This will include several talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers related to their Ph.D. theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new collaborations can be formed and young researchers have the possibility to learn about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover, the conference will enable junior representation theorists to present their work and interact with the broader community, which are crucial activities in the pre-employment season in the fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last 40 years, the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras has enjoyed a great impact of methods from algebraic geometry, in particular from geometric invariant theory and transformation groups. At the same time, this has allowed to feed back into geometry ideas and techniques from representation theory. One of the goals of the Conference on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory is to help strengthen and advance this interaction of geometry and representation theory. The topics of this conference will include: geometric aspects of cluster algebras; semi-invariants for bound quivers; degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in module varieties; moduli problems for finite-dimensional algebras; universal deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces.
