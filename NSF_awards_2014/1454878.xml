    <AbstractNarration>Funds are requested to support students to attend the second IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS), which is sponsored by IEEE ComSoc and will be held in San Francisco, CA, USA, October 29 - 31, 2014. IEEE CNS conference is a spin-off of IEEE INFOCOM, and is positioned to be a core ComSoc conference that serves as a premier forum for communications and network researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and users to exchange ideas, techniques and tools, raise awareness, and share experience related to security and privacy. It provides a unique bridge for the communications and networking community and the security community. The technical scope of this conference encompasses a large number of areas in communications and network security, which facilitates gathering of prominent scientists from academia, governments and industries from around the world to discuss the emerging and multidisciplinary frontiers of networking security technology. The travel grant tends to benefit a wider demographic of graduate students, which will help to broaden participation in the research area of communications and network security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the attendance of approximately 10-15 US-based graduate students. The selection process for the travel award will involve a sub-committee of the CNS 2014 Executive Committee, chaired by the PI. The travel award will target graduate students, in particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.</AbstractNarration>
