    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Wiley College seeks to establish strategies to strengthen and enhance STEM teaching, learning, and research and to improve students' access to and retention in STEM programs. Eighty-five percent of the students at Wiley College are African-American, with a growing number of Hispanic students. Most of the students are first-generation college students and/or are from low socio-economic backgrounds. The project seeks to implement interventions and strategies to increase the academic preparation of the students seeking graduate degrees in a STEM field that can serve as models for other institutions with open admission policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following activities are proposed: a six week long pre-college Mathematics camp and new minors in Computer Sciences and Physics to strengthen students' quantitative skills; an interdisciplinary STEM journal club and an undergraduate research program to prepare students for graduate studies; and professional development for faculty and support staff. Wiley College seeks to share and disseminate evidence-based best practices and findings on retention, academic engagement, and enhancement of STEM undergraduate majors, particularly at conferences for open door admission institutions.</AbstractNarration>
