    <AbstractNarration>This proposal undertakes an innovative galaxy survey meant to become a treasury for astronomers and, just as importantly, a valuable science education platform for the public. It primarily uses a data set from the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) telescope located on Maui, Hawaii. This data set, called the "PS1 Optical Galaxy Survey (POGS)" covers 75% of the sky, and will be combined with data from the ultraviolet, infrared, and radio regimes. When combined, this information will provide transformational insight regarding the variety and current state of galaxy structure in the nearby Universe. In order to accomplish this work, which is computationally intensive and also requires individual inspection, the proposers plan to use involvement of volunteer citizen scientists. This results in a natural, world-wide opportunity for astronomy education. In fact, this work is already underway, with a rapidly growing user base (5,800 volunteers at present). In addition, summer mentoring of female high school students as participants in science analysis of POGS products, providing an opportunity to train an underrepresented group in the STEM fields in scientific methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To measure galactic structural properties unbiased by the mask of recent star formation and dust, the proposers are conducting a citizen-scientist enabled nearby galaxy survey based on the unprecedented optical imaging from Pan-STARRS1 (PS1), but also incorporating ancillary multi-wavelength data from the ultraviolet and infrared regimes (via GALEX and WISE). The PS1 Optical Galaxy Survey (POGS) will cover 3pi steradians (75% of the sky), about twice the footprint of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For each cataloged galaxy, publicly-distributed computing contributed by thousands of volunteers will enable pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, which in turn provides key physical parameters such as the local stellar mass surface density, star formation rate (SFR), and dust attenuation. Sufficiently nearby galaxies will be processed using complete UV-optical-IR SED information as part of a base sample, whereas distant but more numerous galaxies will be processed with optical only data due to the resolution of ancillary observations. With pixel SED fitting output the proposers will then constrain parametric models of galaxy structure and measure non-parametric morphology indicators in a more meaningful way than ordinarily achieved, by operating on images of estimated physical parameters.</AbstractNarration>
