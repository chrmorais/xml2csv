    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Angela K. Wilson and LeGrande Slaughter at the University of North Texas for three summers, starting in 2015. The Site is entitled, "Opportunities in Chemistry at the Interface of Computation and Experiment at the University of North Texas." The site will support eight students per summer in a ten week program. The UNT Chemistry Department is a Ph.D.-granting program with a strong record of undergraduate research involvement. Emphasis in the proposed REU site is placed on the integration of computational chemistry and experiment. Students will undergo diverse training at the interface of theory and experiment, in areas such as solar cells, catalysis, forensic chemistry, semiconductors, chemical sensors, targeted molecule delivery, atmospheric chemistry, interfacial chemistry, and theoretical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The UNT REU program will focus on increasing research opportunities for a diverse group of students, with special efforts to recruit students from underserved populations and institutions, and students at the early stage of their undergraduate studies. Students will be exposed to a wide range of career, research, community service, and leadership opportunities in chemistry, including direct interactions with successful chemists, and visits to companies. Successful attainment of the program goals will enhance the infrastructure for science education for underserved populations, and continued contacts with REU participants and partnering predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) will enable identification of effective practices for promoting research success, which will be disseminated to the broader research community.</AbstractNarration>
