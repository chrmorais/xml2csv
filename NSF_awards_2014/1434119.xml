    <AbstractNarration>SES-143119&lt;br/&gt;Suzanne Staggenborg &lt;br/&gt;Sharon M. Quinsaat &lt;br/&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News reports and academic scholarship suggest that migrants continue to maintain ties to their homelands, from the traditional practice of remittance transfers to overthrow of non-democratic governments and participation in elections. While much is known about why migrants have a homeland orientation, information on how they become engaged in civic movements working for political and social change remains scant. This study analyzes why and how some political organizations of migrants established in their host societies become involved in actions to institute democracy in the homeland. Using the case of Filipinos in the United States and Netherlands, the study examines the process of migrant mobilization in homeland democracy struggles and identifies the structural and cultural factors that facilitate and inhibit such action. The researcher will study eight political organizations comprised mostly of Filipinos in the two countries. The researcher will use process tracing and qualitative comparative analysis approaches to analyze data from archival resources and semi-structured interviews. The researcher will examine differences in outcomes and causal mechanisms and processes that led to these variations. Comparison will be made based on national context, organizational resources, and time period. This research contributes to social movement theory, which has offered cogent explanations and comparisons of national movements but has failed to address patterns of homeland-oriented migrant mobilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the ways in which migrants organize and engage across borders and how migrants promote democratization in their countries of origin. Findings will potentially provide useful insights to organizations involved in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and the promotion of democracy. Research results will also be of possible use to activists, scholars, and policy makers who want to understand (1) how diaspora mobilization are located within the broad patterns of global economic and civic transformation, (2) how it affects the resolution of conflicts, and (3) how it encourages or hinders democratization. With the increased movement of people, this research will contribute to an increased understanding of whether and to what extent diasporas consolidate or fragment state-society relations and become agents of democratization in post-authoritarian homeland states, given their socialization with values in Western societies.</AbstractNarration>
