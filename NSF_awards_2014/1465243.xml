    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating silicon carbide (SiC) integrated circuit technology to fill the need for extreme environment electronics, which, in turn, facilitates improvements in energy efficiency and enables new system architectures for mobile transportation systems. Within the broader scope of integrated circuitry, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters are the subject of this activity. High temperature SiC analog-to-digital data converters (SiC ADCs) are important because they can reside within an internal combustion engine or electric vehicle engine and convert analog sensor data to a digital form before transmission to the vehicle?s control computer. This will have the impact of increasing data rates, improving signal integrity, reducing shielding requirements on cabling, and enabling the potential for wireless transmission of data in the future. The project will result in a prototype of a SiC-based data acquisition system (DAQ) for extreme environment applications utilizing SiC ADCs. The SiC DAQ system has the main unique feature that it can survive very high temperatures (&gt; 300°C). This provides the advantage of being able to sense and convert key data parameters in-situ at temperatures exceeding 300°C, a capability not currently available, which will improve the reliability and fuel efficiency for all types of vehicles (planes, trains, automobiles). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and manufacture of SiC materials for uses outside of simple power devices requires new design for manufacturing (DFM) techniques. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery towards commercial application: 1) to understand and mitigate the manufacturing variability of SiC-CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor); and 2) to qualify the reliability of a full-scale component. To do this, the team will assemble a demonstration unit that has sufficient capability to illustrate the potential for the technology while being sufficiently simple to support extensive test and characterization for reliability in a real world application. In addition, personnel involved in this project, masters and doctoral students in electrical engineering, will receive first-hand technology translation experience through the design activities undertaken that proceed from the feasibility to prototype phase with serious consideration of the eventual product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Ozark Integrated Circuits of Fayetteville, Arkansas in guiding the commercialization aspects of the technology as it transitions from feasibility proof to prototype in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
