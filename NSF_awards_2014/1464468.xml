    <AbstractNarration>Center for Interdisciplinary Forensic Science Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological advances in the forensic sciences have made it possible to provide probative information in the investigation and adjudication of criminal activity. With the growing influence of science-based evidence comes the responsibility to provide objective, well researched, and defensible scientific data. The increasing reliance on forensic science by the justice system has also intensified the scrutiny of laboratory examination procedures and technology; the ethical standards of practitioners; and the technical accuracy of scientific testimony. The popular media and scientific experts have documented the issues and limitations confronting forensic laboratories. A coordinated industry-university research effort is essential to identify and implement improvements needed to strengthen the application of science to legal proceedings in order to address these challenges. With respect to the broader impacts of the proposed research, this group of researchers envisions serving as a primary source for applied forensic science research that will benefit society by providing the justice system with more definitive answers to legal questions. The interdisciplinary nature of their partnerships has the potential to address current limitations in forensic science methodologies, which may have impeded or prevented the administration of justice. In a broad sense, the group seeks to improve crime-solving tools through the increases the accuracy and reliability of the justice system and stop criminals before they re-offend, thereby saving society the costs of increased crime. Improvements in forensic science efficiencies reduce costs to governments to provide the service. For example, efficiency improvements occur through greater use of automation, which private enterprise may develop into a commercial product based on university-based research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several initial projects are proposed for the Center for Interdisciplinary Forensic Science Research. These projects focus on chemistry, biology, and biomechanical engineering methods as well as on approaches to address forensic science related problems. With respect to forensic biology applications, the researchers will develop a method that will assist in characterizing bloodstain patterns to a specific type of injury or event. The identification of particular wound cells in an otherwise non-specific bloodstain pattern can reveal the one true cause or source of the bloodshed from many possible mechanisms or wound sites. The researchers also propose to develop of a digestible swab to optimize the collection of biological evidence. While cotton swabs are effective in capturing biological material from solubilized stains, they are problematic in that significant amounts of sample can be retained on the swab following standard extraction procedures. Importantly, the amount of recovered sample has direct impact on testing. With respect to forensic chemistry applications, the researchers will conduct studies that focus on surface modification treatments associated with trace evidence samples. Current instrumentation methods lack the sensitivity to detect ultra-thin layers. However, newer technology methods have the potential to significantly improve the forensic analysis of various trace evidence materials, including fibers, paint, explosive residues, and surface modified glass. In addition, a comprehensive study on UV absorbers in clearcoat paint samples and UV micro-spectra of undyed fibers will be conducted in order to catalog the UV characteristics of these commonly encountered materials. Further, the tampering of pharmaceuticals by healthcare professionals, particularly paramedics, is a serious and growing problem. The researchers will explore methods to provide an affordable, portable, robust, reliable, and in situ screening test to detect tampered drugs. Another issue encountered by forensic drug analysts is the identity of the various isomeric forms of drugs. The researchers will explore methods to provide confirmatory data on the specific identity and characterization of particular isomers when coupled to a searchable database. The proposed methods will be designed to distinguish natural vs. synthetic source, route of synthesis, and illicit vs. legal source to controlled substance samples. The researchers will develop analytical devices to extract drugs of abuse from dried urine. With respect to forensic biomechanical engineering applications, they will design studies to advance fundamental understanding of the analysis of fracture patterns in order to provide further insight into the mechanism of an injury, such as bending, compression or torsion, and the direction of applied force and location of applied load on the body part. Models will be developed that are capable of controlling specimen-to-specimen variation. These models will be used to construct fracture pattern "maps" linked with external loading conditions and subject-specific biological factors. An additional biomechanical engineering project proposes to investigate blood stain pattern analysis and interpretation in order to improve the accuracy of blood stain pattern analysis (area of origin, for example), reduce the analysis time, and to have a non-contact method of evidence documentation for analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant is jointly supported by NSF and the National Institute of Justice.</AbstractNarration>
