    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on "Macromolecular Materials: From Synthesis to Applications" offers a comprehensive polymer program covering advances in macromolecular synthesis, biomolecular materials, theory and simulation, characterization, rheology, processing, nanomaterials and materials uses. These topics will be covered by twenty-two experts including representatives of underrepresented minorities. The conference offers a comprehensive opportunity for the exchange and cross-fertilization of ideas among both academic and industrial polymer scientists and engineers. The main program will be preceded the weekend before by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) organized and run by post-docs and graduate students, at which they will present and discuss their work with their peers and benefit from a Panel discussion with experts. The postdocs and graduate students will subsequently attend the main conference.</AbstractNarration>
