    <AbstractNarration>Theoretical physics has become increasingly important in understanding complex living systems and is positioned to play a key role in addressing phenomena and behavior on the cellular and multicellular level. Investigations on this scale can also lead to new fundamental theoretical physics principles and advances. This Physics Frontiers Centers (PFC) award to the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics - Houston (CTBP-H) will continue work begun during the past PFC awards at the interface of theoretical physics and biology. The CTBP-H will use information from biomolecules, self-organization in living and non-living material, and non-equilibrium statistical physics in order to create a theoretical biological physics framework for cells and multicellular units. Through interactions with local medical institutions the work can impact biomedicine. Investigations of the self-organization of small-scale matter can impact nanoscale technology and material design. The CTBP-H will continue to provide unique training and fostering of young scientists in biological physics. It will support postdoctoral, graduate, and summer undergraduate research, and also reach underrepresented groups at the University of Houston. In addition, the CTBP-H will act as a focal point of scientific community activities, hosting a visiting scholars program, running workshops, and coordinating student networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CTBP-H will be working to find new fundamental principles and paradigms to understand the complex behavior of cells, as well as the coordination of cells into multicellular functional units. The major research activities include: advancing the understanding of gene-based information storage and utilization, developing theoretical frameworks for the mechanical aspects of eukaryotic cells, and combining these insights to study the self-organization of cells into multicellular biofilms and tissues. In collaboration with local medical centers they will apply their newfound insights from biological physics in biomedical contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Physics Frontiers Centers award is co-funded by the Physics Frontiers Centers Program in the Division of Physics, the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry, and the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research within the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences within the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
