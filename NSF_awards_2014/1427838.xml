    <AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring equipment to advance real-time in situ monitoring of data related to water quantity and quality, aims to develop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to &lt;br/&gt;- Obtain measurements of temperature, water dissolved oxygen, water depth, flow rate, and pH value spatially and temporally with high resolution and accuracy;&lt;br/&gt;- Apply WSN-collected real-time, large-scale heterogeneous data to develop, calibrate, and validate water quantity and quality models, to characterize interactions among water resources, climate changes, and human impact to provide more accurate prediction for water sustainability management under different scenarios; and&lt;br/&gt;- Compile and distribute regional and national measurements and design a database/online repository.&lt;br/&gt;Hydrologists, water resource scientists, and water resource engineers will utilize the WSN-framework with the expectation of&lt;br/&gt;- Deriving understanding of complex interactions among water resource, global climate change, and human impacts from data inference;&lt;br/&gt;- Utilizing the research results to provide effective and economic solutions for sustainable water resource management;&lt;br/&gt;- Providing a current water quantity and quality database and online repository for others to increase collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation enables the collaborative application of technologies to water resource management research advancing understanding of complex problems to optimize consumption of limited water under different climate conditions. It also contributes to establish an appropriate environment to broaden students' knowledge and research experience, and encourages participation of underrepresented minorities/women, Furthermore, research results will be integrated into the curricula in CS and water resource education, as well as introduced to a large number of low-income and minority students within their communities in grades 6-12.</AbstractNarration>
