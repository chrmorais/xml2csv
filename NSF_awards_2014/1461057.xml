    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV), located in Vancouver, WA, will support the training of 8 students for 9 weeks during each summer from 2015-2017, within the School of the Environment. The scientific themes are landscape ecology and ecosystem dynamics, contrasting terrestrial and aquatic systems within the Columbia River Basin (CRB). The CRB extends across Washington state and serves as a 'living laboratory' within which to explore how biotic and abiotic factors shape ecosystem form and function. Each summer experience is designed to engage undergraduates in high-quality research and improve skills in scientific inquiry and communication, promote collaboration and the responsible conduct of research, and provide meaningful professional development and social opportunities. The WSUV REU site is targeted specifically toward talented undergraduates who are 'place bound' within the Vancouver, WA/Portland, OR metropolitan area, and attend one of the region's 4-year and 2-year colleges. This REU site also considers applicants from across the US, and works with every accepted student to secure summer housing. Students who have completed at least one year of undergraduate study may apply online through the WSUV REU website noted below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. More specifically, this REU project promotes participation of highly qualified undergraduate students who are typically excluded from immersive summer research experiences due only to their inability to leave home for extended periods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) is used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://vancouver.wsu.edu/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Gretchen Rollwagen-Bollens, rollboll@vancouver.wsu.edu).</AbstractNarration>
