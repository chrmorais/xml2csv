    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) entitled, "RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site for Sustainable Polymer Engineering Research", under the direction of Dr. Sarah E. Morgan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Southern Mississippi proposes to host ten local community college instructors and high school teachers per year for three year for a six-week summer research experience with polymer science and engineering faculty members to perform research in the area of sustainable sustainable materials. Teachers will work in pairs with faculty and student researchers in efforts focused on addressing 21st century grand challenges in engineering. The overall objective of the program is to develop long-term professional relationships between faculty researchers and local teachers by providing meaningful research experiences in relevant polymer engineering research efforts and establishing follow-up activities to extend the impact of the program throughout the school year. Professional development and training in fundamentals of polymer engineering, high performance teams, and scientific communication will be provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed sustainable materials engineering research platform provides the framework to build long-term relationships between engineering faculty and teachers while providing cutting-edge research experiences that are readily incorporated into high school and community college science curricula. The increasing demand for energy and use of hydrocarbons create a wide range of issues, such as the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill of 2010 off the Mississippi Gulf Coast, as well as opportunities, such as production of agriculturally based polymers and alternative energy development, which have high impact on Mississippi teachers and students. The proposed RET will immerse high school teachers and community college faculty in sustainable polymer engineering research in three areas: (1) improved efficiency polymer solar cells, (2) high performance polymers and composites from renewable feedstocks, and (3) environmental impact of synthetic materials in sea water. The proposed effort is a transformative platform for engaging the public in sustainable materials engineering research through relevant research experiences that will resonate with teachers, students and parents. Faculty and graduate student mentors will participate in classroom activities during the school year to ensure the impact of the RET program through the school year.</AbstractNarration>
