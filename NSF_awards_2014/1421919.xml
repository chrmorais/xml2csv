    <AbstractNarration>Datasets that are collected in engineering, social, commercial and other domains are becoming increasingly larger, complex and irregular in structure. There is an urgent need for the development of methods that formalize and automate analysis of such data and are capable of extracting valuable information. Recently, a theoretical framework called signal processing on graphs has emerged as a new approach to analyze data with irregular structure; it extends fundamental signal processing concepts to data residing on arbitrary graphs, as well as formulates data analysis problems as standard signal processing tasks. Moreover, as data often needs to be analyzed at multiple levels of detail, the investigators develop the fundamentals of the multiresolution analysis on graphs, extending the theory of discrete signal processing on graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research extends relevant signal processing concepts that are critical to the development of the multiresolution analysis, including signal translation, scaling, and sampling, to general graphs. The generalized definition is consistent with the classical multiresolution theory for time data and images; it also addresses additional challenges presented by structures and properties of graphs. Additionally, this research involves techniques and devices for the application and implementation of multiresolution analysis methods to data on graphs. The investigators also develop a set of general, theoretical methodologies that can later be instantiated and applied to datasets of different origin, nature and structure.</AbstractNarration>
