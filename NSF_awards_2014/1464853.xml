    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a project with the goal of elucidating the interdependence of deformation history, microstructure and thermomechanical properties in surface generation by novel impression and burnishing-based processes. To accomplish this, an experimental study will utilize controlled deformation platforms and a suite of advanced characterization methods to resolve local material conditions in the modified subsurface. Predictive models of microstructure and thermomechanical properties will be calibrated using these results to enable multi-role surface modification. The primary educational objective is the creation of a series of immersive experiences for students to elicit interest in manufacturing research. This includes deep dives in coupled design/manufacturing problems for minority high school students and a series of hands-on manufacturing design challenges for undergraduates. Graduate students will also engage in mentorship of high school students on semester-long design projects. These educational experiences are complemented by the integration of research outcomes in curricula and development of an interactive manufacturing speaker series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will result in new manufacturing processes that enable direct control of surface properties for a broad range of engineering components. This capability will benefit the nation's economy in enabling domestic manufacturers to be globally competitive in automotive, aerospace and biomedical systems applications where component surfaces strongly influence performance, service life, and operating cost. Societal benefits of the research include the rapid development of a new class of high-performance, surface-engineered components (e.g., turbine blades, bearing seals, hard-tissue implants) that will improve quality of life through enhanced performance. The integrated educational activities will help to develop the future domestic manufacturing workforce by promoting interest in manufacturing-related studies among high school students and undergraduates through novel experiential learning opportunities. Students will also gain globally-aware perspectives in problem solving activities as they will be connected across academic levels and cultural backgrounds in formal mentor-mentee relationships. Doctoral students will benefit from collaborative research opportunities in the form of international research exchanges and industrial internships.</AbstractNarration>
