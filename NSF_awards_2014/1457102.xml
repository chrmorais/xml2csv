    <AbstractNarration>During normal development, signals between cells in the early embryo can have&lt;br/&gt;substantial influence on how the body develops, such as how the eyes and brain&lt;br/&gt;become localized in the head or how the spinal cord becomes localized on the back and&lt;br/&gt;not the belly. These early events have a tremendous effect on the organization of the&lt;br/&gt;tissues within the body and are critical for normal development of all animals. This&lt;br/&gt;project will determine how changes in early developmental mechanisms can lead to&lt;br/&gt;formation of new body parts. The three study animals are segmented worms, and offer&lt;br/&gt;the advantage that their embryos possess only 16 to 64 cells when these critical early&lt;br/&gt;signaling events occur. This contrasts with the approximately 1000 cells at a comparable&lt;br/&gt;stage in the vertebrate embryo. Thus, development will be studied on the single cell level,&lt;br/&gt;and similar cells can be compared across distantly related animals. The specific goals of&lt;br/&gt;this study are to identify the signaling cell and the molecules responsible for instructing&lt;br/&gt;surrounding cells to correctly position and generate body parts. The proposed study will&lt;br/&gt;provide strong STEM training opportunities by integrating scientific training with research&lt;br/&gt;for college students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. In addition, there will&lt;br/&gt;be ongoing community outreach activities, including hands-on activities with several&lt;br/&gt;different K-12 age groups in the local school districts to teach about animal biodiversity&lt;br/&gt;of the oceans, and general talks to adults in the local community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand how developmental changes lead to a range of body&lt;br/&gt;plans, and represents a unique opportunity to gain insight into the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;developmental programs. A group of animals known as the Spiralia exhibit enormous&lt;br/&gt;body plan diversity, yet many phyla in this clade share a highly stereotypic embryological&lt;br/&gt;program called spiralian development. This conservation allows studies of the evolution&lt;br/&gt;of homologous embryonic cell lineages with single cell resolution across diverse taxa.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the molecular signaling repertoire of a single cell will be determined, and the&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary plasticity of its organizing activity will be assessed by comparing distantly&lt;br/&gt;related species. Spiralian development will be investigated experimentally in the&lt;br/&gt;annelids Capitella teleta, Platynereis dumerilii and Chaetopterus sp. The phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;position and embryonic studies of the three species will be used to reconstruct the&lt;br/&gt;ancestral cellular and molecular characteristics of annelid organizing activity. Specific&lt;br/&gt;goals of the project utilizing the three annelids are: 1) deletion of single cells in early&lt;br/&gt;stage embryos to identify cell(s) possessing 'organizing activity', 2) identification of&lt;br/&gt;molecular signals that mediate organizing activity, 3) determination of the function of&lt;br/&gt;organizing signals by knockdown and mis-expression studies. The proposed study will&lt;br/&gt;provide strong training opportunities by integrating scientific training with research, and&lt;br/&gt;continue to develop Capitella and Platynereis as annelid models for Evo-Devo studies.&lt;br/&gt;There will be ongoing community outreach activities, including hands-on activities with&lt;br/&gt;several different age groups in the local school districts that highlight biodiversity in the&lt;br/&gt;oceans, and general talks to adult audiences in the local community.</AbstractNarration>
