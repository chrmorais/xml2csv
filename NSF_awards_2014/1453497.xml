    <AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for the IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications to be held in March 2015 in St. Louis, MO. The conference spans many technologies that are fundamental to Cyber-Physical Systems specifically, including sensor systems, as well as the computer and information sciences more broadly. This project will fund 20 students to attend the conference, and a selection committee and process will be used to choose from potential invitees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference provides important networking opportunities for the students, and will cover technologies that are fundamental to future CPS. Ultimately, attendance and participation in conference activities including the student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.</AbstractNarration>
