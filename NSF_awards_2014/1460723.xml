    <AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in Optics (RiO) is a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program at the College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science Foundation. Optics involves the study of light and the year 2015 has been recognized as the International Year of Light. The goal for the three years of support is to educate and conduct research with ten undergraduates per year in the field of optics. The field is a burgeoning area of industry and consumer product development, academic research, and energy generation. In the commercial sector, optical products are integral to everyday lives through smartphone displays, LEDs for lighting, and imaging systems used in the medical field. In the energy sector, optical concentrators are being used in solar power facilities to improve the efficiency of electricity generation. In the academic sector, researchers and students are developing novel technologies, exploring the fundamental limits of the world, and developing the telescopes imaging distant stars and their planets. These topics and others are the areas of research for the undergraduates selected for the RiO program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of RiO is to develop an interest in optics within the student participants and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in a STEM field. A metric of 50% female and 60% minority representation has been set for this program. The participants additionally will have workshops in introductory optics, ethics training, presentation skills, and lab and laser safety and at the end of each summer will hone their presentation skills through both oral and poster events. Thus, RiO will educate future researchers and engineers in this recognized and important field for the United States in the 21st century. The participants will serve as role models for future generations by encouraging others to pursue STEM research, especially in optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RiO participants will engage in experimental, theoretical, and modeling research over the breadth of the optics field, including optical engineering, imaging systems, photonics, and optical physics. A project on bio-inspired optical design based on models of animal eyes has the potential to improve upon the designs of lens systems currently in use. Research on a better understanding of the optical properties of semiconductors can lead to a multitude of benefits including improved lasers and future optical technologies. Research on improved internal building illumination using daylighting means less dependency on fossil fuel electricity generation. Development of a platform independent toolbox for quantum control and measurement can lead to improved quantum information security and cryptography along with error correction. A project in the optical detection and classification of special nuclear material can determine if the matter is benign or threatening. Specific research will develop endoscopes with both forward and backward optics that can see tumors that are hidden from view for solely front-viewing systems. Research on the effect of mid-spatial frequency optical surface error will allow control of such during the manufacture of multi-meter telescope mirrors, such as the Giant Magellan Telescope. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These and other projects will expand our knowledge in and use of optics to solve challenges and develop new technology. The student participants will also have workshops in introductory optics, ethics training, presentation and writing skills, and lab and laser safety. Thus, the student participants will not only be conducting research at the forefront of optics, but they will be trained to succeed as researchers if they pursue graduate studies or enter the workforce after graduation.</AbstractNarration>
