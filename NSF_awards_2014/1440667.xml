    <AbstractNarration>This project enhances the perfSONAR network measurement system to improve the application impact and utility of network performance information. The perfSONAR system monitors and measures the network cyberinfrastructure that connects scientists with resources and ever-increasing data. This project increases the impact of this network telemetry on the performance of large-scale data applications by calibrating network data and making it actionable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it can be determined when the network is behaving correctly and when it is lightly or heavily loaded, scientific workflows have yet to be provided the same level of performance estimation that car drivers can get from a navigation system in a car. This project calibrates and quantifies data from scientific data networks and applications in order to provide reasonable predictions for the logistics of moving scientific data. This includes controlled experiments under repeatable conditions as well as longitudinal studies with high performance networks and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, efforts are made to scale the perfSONAR ecosystem by orders of magnitude, and to move toward a more scalable service model for subscribing components and developing autonomic configuration and management of measurement activities. As the perfSONAR system moves outside the network operations community, many aspects of scalability will need to be addressed.</AbstractNarration>
