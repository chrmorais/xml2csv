    <AbstractNarration>Spectrum sharing plays a key role in realizing plans to make available new swaths of spectrum for wireless applications. The benefits of spectrum sharing cannot be fully realized without addressing interference among coexisting heterogeneous secondary networks. Although coexistence issues in the ISM bands have been studied before, the situation in the TV bands and other shared access spectrum (e.g., 3.5 GHz band) is more complex and challenging due to the signal propagation characteristics, incumbent protection rules, and the disparity of PHY/MAC strategies of secondary systems. To date, most research efforts have focused on incumbent protection, and little attention has been given to the coexistence of secondary systems in the context of spectrum sharing. The proposed research aspires to fill this void by 1. studying the viability of using stochastic neural networks for modeling and solving the CDM problem and 2. developing novel rendezvous techniques for unicast and multicast scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group plans to integrate project findings in relevant graduate courses at their respective institutions. In the second year of the project, the investigators will jointly organize a session on heterogeneous coexistence and spectrum sharing at the Virginia Tech annual Symposium and Wireless Summer School, which is an educational outreach event that serves the wireless industry. The group also proposes to give a tutorial presentation on heterogeneous coexistence and spectrum sharing at relevant conferences, including the IEEE DySPAN Conference, the flagship conference on dynamic spectrum access and spectrum sharing technologies. The group will also collaborate with our industry partners from Raytheon and Space Micro to demonstrate a sample of the proposed solutions on their spectrum-agile radio platforms.</AbstractNarration>
