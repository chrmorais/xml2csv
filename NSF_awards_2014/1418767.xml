    <AbstractNarration>Carroll University has received funds to create a research and education center at the Carroll University Greene Field Station (GFS). Despite the lack of on-site facilities for research and appropriate infrastructure to support data acquisition, management, and dissemination, Carroll faculty and students have conducted research at the GFS outdoor laboratory since the 1970s. The renovation of an existing building into a research facility will expand research agendas, provide infrastructure needed for outside collaboration and community use, and offer space for the university to introduce the experimenting across the curriculum initiative, a groundbreaking project that will integrate research and education, educating all students in scientific literacy. The research and education center will also provide the foundation needed for Carroll faculty to conduct ongoing projects both in ecological and pedagogical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expanded GFS will serve as an important research facility not just for science students and faculty at Carroll University, but also for non-science majors to become citizen scientists. The observational and experimental data accessible at the facility will contribute to public participation in scientific research efforts and provide benefits to society. All Carroll students will be trained in the processes of sciences as they submit data collected at the GFS to regional and national databases. One quarter of Carroll's undergraduate students are first generation and 21% come from economically disadvantaged families. Providing an opportunity for students to participate in well-supported inquiry based learning at the facility through their general education coursework will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the processes of science. The new facility will also broaden collaborations across universities, area school districts, non-profit agencies, and governmental agencies, thus enhancing the infrastructure for research and education in the community.
