    <AbstractNarration>Emphasis Year in Geometric Analysis at Northwestern, April 1, 2015 - March 31, 2016, Northwestern University, Evanston IL. This grant is for a four-day workshop and a seven-day summer school at Northwestern University on the topic of geometric analysis, with the goals of training junior mathematicians in the field and stimulating new research. Geometric analysis is the study of differential equations on geometric spaces, such as the equations of Einstein which describe gravitation in terms of the curvature of space-time. The four-day workshop, to be held in May 2015, will feature 18 talks by experts on the topic of Ricci curvature, a central object in geometric analysis. The summer school, to be held in July 2015, will include six introductory mini-courses on various topics within geometric analysis, aimed at graduate students and recent PhDs. Grant funds will be used primarily for the travel costs of attendees who are graduate students or postdoctoral scholars at US institutions. The organizing committee will seek broad and diverse participation in these activities, and will especially encourage the participation of women mathematicians and members of other under-represented groups. More information on these events, which are part of an Emphasis Year in Geometric Analysis at Northwestern, can be found on the website: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.northwestern.edu/emphasisGA/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last few decades, Ricci curvature has emerged as a central concept in several branches of geometric analysis, including: Riemannian geometry and geometric flows; limits of Riemannian manifolds; complex geometry and Kahler-Einstein metrics; metric measure spaces and optimal transport. The four-day Workshop on Ricci Curvature will bring together experts on all of these topics, in order to educate the next generation of geometric analysts, stimulate new ideas and create new research collaborations. The seven-day Summer School in Geometric Analysis will feature mini-courses on six important and overlapping areas of geometric analysis: the mean curvature flow; the Ricci flow; Ricci curvature; the Kahler-Ricci flow; the complex Monge-Ampere equation; and geodesics in the space of Kahler metrics. These courses will be given by experts in the field and will be aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral scholars with the goal of bringing them up to the forefront of research in geometric analysis.</AbstractNarration>
