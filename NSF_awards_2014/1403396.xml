    <AbstractNarration>This research project explores uncharted regimes of 'strongly correlated matter' (matter which behaves notably differently from what one would expect based on knowledge gained by studying only the constituents in isolation) by pushing the experimental state-of-the-art in atomic physics, quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. In addition, the group actively collaborates with theoretical groups to develop frameworks for understanding these novel tools and complex systems. The project focuses on the diversity of quantum many-body phases that may arise from the unusual properties of the element dysprosium under the influence of specialized excitation by laser radiation. This program will build the experimental capability to seek these phases using the successful machine assembled under a prior NSF CAREER grant for laser cooling and trapping dysprosium. The research concerns physics and technical skills that find application in a variety of significant areas of technology, most notably lasers and photonics for telecommunications and advanced novel solid-state materials for electronic devices. The research provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student education in a state-of-the-art laser lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several groups have realized a synthetic magnetic field using alkali atoms either in traps or in optical lattices as well as one-dimensional spin-orbit coupling. Spin-orbit coupling in a Bose gas can lead to superfluid phases with stripe order and a rich phase diagram. These achievements announce an exciting new frontier for exploring quantum many-body physics in quantum gases, connecting to existing phenomena and challenges in condensed matter systems. The group aspires to pursue brand-new phenomena barely, or perhaps not at all, realizable in the solid state by employing high-spin quantum gases of dysprosium atoms. Dysprosium (Dy) offers several advantages for realizing unusual, strongly correlated states and exotic spinor phases beyond those phases widely discussed in the context of utilizing dysprosium?s large magnetic dipole moment. The large spin and narrow optical transitions of Dy atoms should allow for the generation of synthetic magnetic fields one order of magnitude larger than those in the alkalis, but with considerable reduction of the heating rate. Consequently, creating quantum Hall states in Dy may be more practicable than in the currently employed alkali atoms.</AbstractNarration>
