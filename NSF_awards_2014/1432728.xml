    <AbstractNarration>This project is preparing for institution-wide transformation of teaching and learning practices at a large public research university. It is continuing to expand a process that has already begun, building infrastructure around a core initiative called TILE (Transform, Interact, Learn, and Engage for success in STEM education). TILE requires faculty implementers to invest in professional development and the University to invest in technology-rich classrooms. TILE classrooms are remodeled after the SCALE-UP classrooms used in physics and other disciplines in the physical sciences that have been proven to be effective learning environments when paired with appropriate pedagogy. SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) is a mature, proven evidence-based method of education that puts students in small groups around circular tables and engages them in active construction of knowledge. Using computers, they pull information from the Internet to use in active solving problems. In SCALE-UP the task of getting disciplinary content is shifted to the internet and the process of solving difficult problems occurs in small groups during class time, where students help one another and are guided by expert instructors. This model is currently in use in more than 100 institutions of higher education. Appropriate pedagogy is learned by faculty instructors through a professional development program at the university that has already been designed and implemented by the Center for Teaching and the Office of Information Technology Services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TILE has the support of a number of faculty members and administrators, but the process of transformation is still in its early stages. There are a number of possible barriers and issues that are likely to be encountered in this institution as in all large research universities. The main goals of this project are to anticipate and prepare for those challenges and create a process for overcoming them. The goals of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;* Assess the organizational climate for promoting and sustaining innovative teaching and learning practices in STEM departments&lt;br/&gt;* Create a Leadership Institute to provide College and Department leadership with evidence-based practices for supporting teaching and learning at the department and program level.&lt;br/&gt;* Create a process to iteratively increase the use of evidence-based scientific teaching and learning practices in STEM classes, particularly in general education and introductory STEM courses. Included in the plan to increase evidence-based teaching in an iterative process is a set of assessment tools that will measure the benefits for students derived from improved teaching and learning practices.</AbstractNarration>
