    <AbstractNarration>Nuclear astrophysics is the application of nuclear physics knowledge obtained from laboratory studies to the universe and its contents. This is essential for understanding how the chemical elements are produced, the ways stars are powered, what causes exploding stars called supernovae, the origin of cosmic rays, and more. A key research frontier is based on using neutrinos, subatomic particles that have no electric charge and very little mass, and which barely interact with matter. This makes neutrinos hard to detect, but allows them to escape from and thus reveal physical conditions in the deep interiors of astrophysical objects. The unique information they carry will help resolve longstanding questions in nuclear astrophysics. Research is needed to further develop detection techniques and to draw conclusions from the data. There is high demand for students and postdocs trained in this research area. The topics covered, which also include black holes, dark matter, and the universe itself, capture the imagination of the public and attract young people to explore careers in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is intended to lead to significant gains in our understanding of astrophysical objects and neutrinos themselves. The knowledge of theoretical physics and astrophysics will be applied to help lead to new detections of astrophysical neutrinos and to develop new understandings from that data. A central focus of this project is on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, the cosmic flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by the explosions of massive stars over the past several billion years. This flux has not been detected yet, but it is within reach, and careful work is needed to help isolate this faint signal. Related topics include detecting other astrophysical neutrino sources, the nature of supernovae, and the properties of neutrinos. Junior scientists supported by the grant will be mentored in the full range of skills needed to be successful in their future careers. To maximize broader impacts, the work integrates efforts in research, mentoring, teaching, and outreach, with a focus on underrepresented populations, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Division of Physics, the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.</AbstractNarration>
