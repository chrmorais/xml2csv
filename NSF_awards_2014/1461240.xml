    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Nebraska, located in Lincoln, NE, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015- 2017. This award is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences. The program focuses on redox biology, which involves oxidation-reduction linked biological reactions, redox signaling and regulation, and cellular defense mechanisms that minimize oxidative damage/stress. The summer program will enable students to explore fundamental redox processes related to biotechnology and the environment. REU participants will conduct individual research projects under the guidance of a faculty mentor in the Redox Biology Center. The mentors offer a breadth of multidisciplinary approaches and share a common goal of understanding critical redox-active processes. Students will receive experimental training in a variety of areas including molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, and protein crystallography, and will utilize state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Students will attend journal club meetings, career development seminars, lunch discussion groups, and social activities to enhance their cohort experience. The program will conclude with students presenting their research findings at a campus-wide poster session. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool and tracking the career paths of former participants. Participant selection will be made by faculty and will be based on academic achievements, research interests, and career goals. Students at smaller institutions with limited research opportunities and those from underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply. Participants receive a stipend, full room and board, and travel assistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The goal of the training program is to involve undergraduate students in broad-based research and significantly impact their career decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.
