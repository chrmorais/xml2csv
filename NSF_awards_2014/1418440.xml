    <AbstractNarration>This project will research the development and application of new Next Generation curriculum exemplars for middle school science and K-12 teacher preparation foundational level general science (collectively referred to as Next Gen curriculum materials). The project will address the need to develop middle school science curriculum that aligns with the expectations of NGSS by (1) constructing diagnostic tools to assess the alignment of curricula; (2) using the tool for existing curricula in order to field test it; and (3) systematically investigating the effectiveness of the tool. The project will use these tools to revise and test a series of middle school lessons, implement them in the classroom, and study their results. Research on the efficacy of these diagnostic tools will address specific content and evidence of learning in two domains: student middle school science learning and teacher content learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop curriculum diagnostic tools for middle school science. The process of development will include field testing with teachers and students in 60 classrooms (20 life, 20 physical, and 20 earth science classrooms) in high needs areas. It will employ rigorous standards in developing and applying research-based procedures to produce NGSS curriculum exemplars. The mixed methodology approach will provide in-depth information regarding the alignment of new curriculum materials to the NGSS. The rigorously analyzed and field-tested Next Generation science curriculum exemplars products produced will be broadly disseminated through state and national conferences and networks of programs with which the California State University, East Bay (CSU East Bay) and core partners are in collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
