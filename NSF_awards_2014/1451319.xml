    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1451319&lt;br/&gt;PI: Burg, Karen&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Building a Framework to Advance Research through Undergraduate Participation: Investigating pH in 3D Tissue Test Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award will lead to the development of methods for both constructing complex three dimensional tissues, but also deconstructing the tissues after use such that each layer of the tissue can be analyzed. Developing new techniques for tissue construction that allow facile layer by layer deconstruction or dis-assembly of tissues will allow investigators to ask for the first time how the role of spatial gradients of chemicals, along with cell to cell contacts, impacts the survival and function of individual cells within the tissue and eventually overall tissue function. Along with this innovative research program, the PI will also develop novel mentoring strategies for undergraduates engaged in research. She poses some unconventional hypotheses about a fused research and mentoring methodology which she believes will lead to greater retention of diverse students in STEM fields. With funds from this award, the PI aims to develop a scalable model of fused research and mentoring that will potentially have a high impact on undergraduate research and training, and retention of students engaged in such activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching theme of the proposed work is to quantify and evaluate the role of pH in tissue system applications. To this end, a novel, heterogeneous 3D bench-top system will be developed to model tissue engineered breast and bone. Unlike conventional 3D tissue systems, the breast model will incorporate stacked layers with "peel-able" design, in which each layer has specific characteristics. This design is also unique in that the model may be easily taken apart and analyzed. The orthopedic model will incorporate gel and a ceramic bone graft filler and will explore acidic to basic ranges of pH shift. The breast model will incorporate gel and polymeric beads and will explore neutral to acidic ranges of pH shift. Following culture of either model, the system will be deconstructed, layer by layer, and pH test liquid applied to spots across each paper. In this manner a pH map will be constructed. If successful, the stacking approach will allow, for the first time, mapping of the interior of tissue engineered systems. At the same time the PI will build on a previous Research Experience for Minorities (REM) program to test new methods to provide critical thinking skills to undergraduates engaged in research. She will use a scientific approach to gathering and analyzing data related to the efficacy of current undergraduate research courses and a team-based undergraduate research opportunity as the means to teach critical thinking through research. The results of this study will help provide guidance as to where limited university resources should be applied to provide wide-scale research participation by undergraduates and maximize research results while addressing the need to improve the critical thinking skills of the participants.</AbstractNarration>
