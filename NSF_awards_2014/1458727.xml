    <AbstractNarration>Springfield Technical Community College (STCC) will award 20 scholarships a year to academically talented students pursuing degrees in STEM fields. This project will help academically talented and financially needy students to pursue their career goals in STEM areas and will serve to facilitate a fundamental shift in the perception of STEM programs and careers, especially in underrepresented groups. The project team will collaborate with local and regional industry on curriculum, skills, and certifications needed for employment and advancement, and will have a positive impact on Massachusetts' ability to meet the rising demands for highly skilled technical workers, especially those who hold bachelor's degrees in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive approach to the recruiting and retention of STEM Scholars will be developed in a focused effort on eight majors at STCC. The success rate, as measured by enrollment, increased diversity of the student population, retention, graduation, and job placement will provide insight into successful methods of increasing the number and diversity of students in the STEM pipeline. The program will be designed with proven student support strategies such as peer-mentoring, tutoring, cohort classes, and STEM faculty advising. The project team will leverage several existing programs including a state-funded STEM Starter Academy, cohort classes, Women in STEM club, and the Innovations (STEM-related) speaker series. Results from the project will be presented at the national Achieving the Dream Conference, through the STCC website, podcasts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and in journals devoted to STCC education and at conferences such as the National Academic Advising Association (NACADA) and the Triangle Coalition for STEM Education.</AbstractNarration>
