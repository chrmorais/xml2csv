    <AbstractNarration>This mixed methods research is developing a clearer understanding of transfer student pathways as a means to increase engineering degree production and broaden participation in engineering careers, especially for Hispanic students. The study sites are 4 of the top 10 producers of U.S. Hispanic engineers: The University of Texas at El Paso, Texas A&amp;M University, The University of Texas at Austin, and The University of Texas-Pan American. The investigators are surveying 5,200 students in 7 cohorts who transferred to 4-year institutions. Staff at the 4 institutions are matching survey responses to GPAs and engineering degree attainment so that statistical models can link educational experiences to outcomes. The team is also interviewing a sample of 40 engineering transfer students (50% Hispanic) about their transfer experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hispanics continue to be an untapped pool of prospective STEM talent in United States. Since 2005, Hispanics have exceeded more than 20 percent of students enrolled in the K-12 education system, yet they earned only 10 percent of the engineering degrees awarded in 2007. The state of Texas has uniquely seen rapid economic (GDP) and population growth in the past few years, coupled with a high minority population, making it an important setting for studying transfer student pathways and ultimately broadening participation in engineering. By partnering with the top 4 producers of Hispanic engineers in Texas and 4 of their feeder community colleges (Austin Community College, Blinn College, El Paso Community College, and South Texas College), this project has the potential to dramatically increase the numbers of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic students earning engineering degrees through transfer mechanisms. Project advisory board members have strong professional networks for disseminating the findings to policymakers and educational practitioners who can put the findings into action.</AbstractNarration>
