    <AbstractNarration>The electrical power system has been widely recognized as one of the most important engineering achievements. High power quality and availability are maintained in the bulk power system mainly by enforcing hierarchical operational practices, central decision making, and redundancy. However, this status quo is being challenged by changing generation, consumption, and operational landscapes. In particular, there is increased emphasis on renewable generation and the impetus to improve resiliency to extenuating weather impacts. The challenge is to develop innovative architectural and operational paradigms. A compelling framework to address these goals is provided by low-inertia microgrids. Low-inertia microgrids are a collection of heterogeneous energy sources with limited mechanical inertia that includes photovoltaic (PV) arrays, fuel cells, and energy-storage devices that are interfaced to an AC electric distribution network. The project seeks to highlight fundamental cross-cutting challenges relevant across different research domains in low-inertia AC electrical systems. Broad transformative impacts will follow from integration of the proposed research with an educational dissemination plan, involvement of undergraduates in research, and outreach to the local community and K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to outline fundamental modeling, analysis, and control challenges in low-inertia microgrids. It seeks to unify circuit- and system-theoretic methods to engineer energy technologies that emphasize increased renewable integration, sustainable capacity expansion, and improved electricity access. The research agenda focuses on the twin objectives of optimally engineering low-inertia microgrids while contributing to the foundational science that links power systems, complex networks, and nonlinear dynamical systems. The research outcomes will facilitate a seamless transition to future power systems that are adaptable to local needs, resilient to extenuating impacts, and distributed in control and operation.</AbstractNarration>
