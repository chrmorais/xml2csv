    <AbstractNarration>The Science Learning Community (SLC) Scholarship Project at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg will provide scholarships and academic support to 24 academically talented and financially disadvantaged students from rural areas in Pennsylvania. The SLC Scholars will receive a liberal arts education solidly rooted in science and mathematics. The scholarship support will remove the financial and societal barriers to earning a college degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective is to graduate the SLC Scholars successfully with baccalaureate degrees in Biological Science or Chemistry, and to facilitate their entry into STEM careers or graduate programs through enhancement of support services via curricular and co-curricular activities. Some of these activities include a summer bridge program, a science seminar for freshman scholars, the establishment of study groups, opportunities to develop a mentee/mentor relationship with a faculty member which could lead to undergraduate research, and training as peer mentors, teaching assistants for labs, or tutors for courses to enhance scholars' leadership skills and learning experiences. Career services will also be available, such as a career seminar course, graduate school prep course, and development of relationships with faculty and staff. Additionally, SLC Scholars will help build the next generation of science students by assisting during the university's middle and high school Summer Science and Math Experience and Quest Career camps. The project outcomes, lessons learned, and best practices will be broadly disseminated, contributing to the body of research on model approaches to supporting undergraduate student retention and educational success. Assessment of the efficacy of these different activities will help contribute to expanding the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship projects of this type are successful.</AbstractNarration>
