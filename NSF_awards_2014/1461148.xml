    <AbstractNarration>The REU program at North Carolina State University aims to get more undergraduates interested in pursuing academic and nonacademic careers in mathematics. The program does this by giving the students the opportunity to work on applied research problems in a supportive, collaborative environment that is part of a vibrant research department with strong collaboration with industry and government laboratories. The program combines a strong commitment to outreach, well thought-out programs for students, and a long-standing dedication to diversity in the mathematics work force. The interdisciplinary nature of the REU program attracts students who do not necessarily think of themselves as primarily interested in mathematics (some are double majors, or have math minors). Through this summer experience students learn the power of mathematical models, potentially interesting them in careers in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this REU program students are exposed to challenging and exciting real-world problems arising in industrial and government laboratory research. This experience benefits its participants in ways not possible with traditional coursework. Students learn valuable techniques of applied mathematics and learn how to work in teams to accomplish common objectives. The complexity and open-endedness of the problems provides a challenge that makes learning new techniques worthwhile. The fact that there may be no ready-made structures or body of results to cover the final problem formulation only compounds the excitement. REU students see the value placed on their work by those outside the University, in the "real world" of business and industry.</AbstractNarration>
