    <AbstractNarration>Remarkable progress in the understanding of the brain in recent years is due in part to the increasing role that theory and computational methods are playing in the design of experiments and interpretation of data. The annual Computational and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) conference promotes this process by providing an inclusive forum for the exchange of experimental and theoretical/computational approaches to problems in systems neuroscience. This purpose of this project is to broaden participation at the Cosyne meeting to include more individuals from under-represented groups through a continuing travel grant program targeting early-career scientists, and a new program of mentored travel awards for undergraduates. Both programs will be active for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Cosyne meetings.</AbstractNarration>
