    <AbstractNarration>PI: Sokolov, Igor&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1428919&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI: Acquisition of Raman-AFM-Lifetime System for Materials Research and Training&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance&lt;br/&gt;The requested system has the ability to collect multiple parameters (using Raman, AFM and optical excitation) from the same area of the sample surface, opening the possibility for a better understanding of surface properties. The system has significant advantages over previous systems, including function-structure studies and uses a smaller amount of laser radiation, thus allowing the study of many organic samples in non-destructive way, and faster acquisition of Raman maps. This new version of confocal imaging Raman spectrometer allows collection of Raman spectra over a sample surface much faster than was previously possible. It opens a window of opportunities for both research and education. In addition to allowing studies of organic samples non-destructively, it will achieve faster acquisition of Raman maps allowing the use of the instrument for real-time demonstrations for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the-art integrated Raman-AFM-Lifetime system by WITec Instruments Corp. (Alpha 300R+ Raman system) consists of three integrated parts: a Confocal Raman imaging spectrometer, an atomic force microscope (AFM), and a time-correlated single photon counter. It allows measuring a unique synergistic combination of material parameters, which makes this instrument a unique platform for a large number of potential applications and users. The instrument, hosted at the School of Engineering of Tufts University, will be used by researchers from multiple department and schools across Tufts University as well as outside researchers, including those from the Greater Boston Area (in which no similar instrument exists). The instrument gives the material and stress specific information (the Raman part), physical parameters (topography, electrical charges, viscoelastic moduli of the sample; the AFM part), and lifetime of optical excitation (the lifetime part). All these parameters are measured at the same location on the sample surface. Furthermore, the AFM part will substantially enhance the spatial resolution of the Raman mapping by using a combination with AFM through the tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). The option of single-photon sensitivity and ability to measure life-time of radiated light allow, for example, not only luminescent life-time mapping but also the separation of true Raman and (sometimes Raman-look) fluorescent signals, which is important for quantitative measurements.</AbstractNarration>
