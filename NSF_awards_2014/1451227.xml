    <AbstractNarration>The 10th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) will take place December 2-5, 2014, in Sydney, Australia. This award provides support for 10 US-based graduate students to attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as CoNEXT forms a central part of the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and exposing them to leading-edge research in the field. ACM CoNEXT stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking researchers at an international level, and attending CoNEXT presents an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with the thriving international research community. As in past years, CoNEXT 2014 will include a special student workshop, allowing students to present present their work in progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in writing and presenting technical papers. The support enables students, who would otherwise be unable to attend to participate in the main conference and associated workshops at CoNEXT 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in their field, both in the main conference and the associated workshops, and their inclusion will have a positive impact on the quality of their research. Women and other minorities will be especially encouraged to participate. The CoNEXT conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their knowledge of the field.</AbstractNarration>
