    <AbstractNarration>This project will study magnetized, collisionless shock waves. Collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical environments. Magnetized shocks are produced for example by supernova explosions, by the outflow of hot gases from certain types of stars by the solar wind upstream of planetary magnetospheres, or solar flares. Astrophysical collisionless shocks will be mimicked in the laboratory using high-powered lasers. This will allow their properties to be studied in a detail not currently possible by observing them in space. Collisionless shocks in space affect the particle and field distribution throughout the universe and are believed to be the primary source of cosmic rays. The proposed experiments could open the possibility of studying astrophysics in the laboratory and advance the understanding of space and astrophysical processes such as coronal mass ejections, supernovae or the origin of cosmic rays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magnetized collisionless shocks launched in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA will be fully characterized. In these experiments, an energetic laser pulse of several hundred joules rapidly ablates a solid target embedded in a large (17 m x 0.5 m), and magnetized ambient plasma. Collisionless coupling between the debris ions and ambient plasma accelerates the ambient ions to super-Alfvenic velocities and a self-sustained shock can separate from the laser-plasma piston and propagate through the ambient plasma over large distances. The shock will be characterized by measuring the jump of density, magnetic field, temperature and flow across the ramp in a variety of shock geometries. These experiments could potentially launch quasi-parallel (i.e. Alfvenic) shocks and find evidence of particle acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting for the very first time. The experiments will be compared to two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer simulations performed with an existing multi-dimensional hybrid code.</AbstractNarration>
