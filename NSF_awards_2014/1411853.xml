    <AbstractNarration>Within the context of the increasing need to properly manage our renewable resources, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a potentially powerful tool to enhance fisheries and conserve marine biodiversity. MPAs are regions where fishing is controlled or prohibited. There remains much uncertainty about how effective MPAs really are, and in particular, on how specific traits of marine organisms impact how MPAs function. The goal of this project is to develop and apply new modeling approaches for the analysis and design of MPAs, which will inform both theoretical investigators and policy makers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MPA models will take the form of 2 patch, diffusively coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe the interaction of fish residing in the MPA and in the Fishing Grounds. Fish populations will assumed to be stage structured, and form part of predator-prey foodwebs. The models will incorporate density-dependent reproduction, maturation, natural death, and fishing rates, and mobility rates. Tools from dynamical systems theory will be applied to analyze the models. Empirical fish trait data will be synthesized from the literature to constrain the values of the model parameters. A working group in the final year of the grant will be organized to facilitate the synthesis and integration of the findings, and suggest new ways to better design MPAs and assess their effectiveness. Participants to this event will include not only scientists but also policy makers. This project will ultimately lead to recommendations about when to implement MPAs, where to locate them, and to establish for which organisms they will be most effective. Also noteworthy are the educational impacts arising from the interdisciplinary training of graduate students, as well as undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
