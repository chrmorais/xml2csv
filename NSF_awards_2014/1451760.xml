    <AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for 42nd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to the 2015 ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL). The conference will be held in Mumbai, India, in January 2015. POPL is a forum for the discussion of leading work on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. The conference has a rich tradition of supporting ideas that have made enduring contributions to the theory, design, implementation or application of programming languages. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>
