    <AbstractNarration>The Micron Automata Processor is a reconfigurable non-Von Neumann co-processor which can be used to simultaneously execute multiple Non-deterministic Finite Automata over one or more input data streams. The technology supports an algorithmic model and a programming abstraction that is radically different from any processor or co-processor that is in existence today. The goal of this exploratory project is to conduct early-concept research on the Automata Processor so that the research community has access to techniques and tools for utilizing the technology. &lt;br/&gt;The project is developing algorithmic building blocks, programming techniques, and libraries for enabling researchers and developers to take advantage of this new architectural paradigm, and designing automata-based algorithms to solve path problems in graphs as a step towards exploring general purpose use of this architecture. The project will lead to fundamental research on how to solve problems using a new computational model. Research results will be shared through publications and release of automata libraries, to enable rapid adoption of this new technology by the computing community.</AbstractNarration>
