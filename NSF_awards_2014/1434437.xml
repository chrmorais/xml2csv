    <AbstractNarration>SES-1434437&lt;br/&gt;Nitsan Chorev&lt;br/&gt;Meghan Elizabeth Kallman&lt;br/&gt;Brown University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing studies have produced significant knowledge about what sustains workers in private organizations, such as how ideas are diffused, how mimicry operates, and how unethical behavior spreads. That literature, however, is primarily focused on private organizations in profitmaking situations; though idealism may be present for some actors, the incentive structure for wage-earning workers and volunteers is meaningfully different. This study proposes a new way of thinking about volunteering that combines the insights from organizational sociology with a nuanced appreciation for the motives of these volunteers. The research uses a social movements perspective to analyze Peace Corps volunteers' experience, to gage volunteers' motives, and the trajectories of their altruistic commitment throughout and after their service. This project focuses on the organizational mechanisms that transform volunteers' altruistic identities, and the political consequences of those transformations. The research seeks to understand: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. How volunteers come to understand themselves as volunteers, activists, and professionals;&lt;br/&gt;2. Volunteers' understanding of themselves as Americans, and vis-Ã -vis host community members;&lt;br/&gt;3. The sources and political consequences of burnout and disillusionment among volunteers; and&lt;br/&gt;4. The incentive structure that retains volunteers in social and helping professions despite this burnout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be completed using a mixed-methods research design that combines the benefits of qualitative and quantitative approaches, including field observations at three Peace Corps sites, an online survey of returned Peace Corps volunteers tracing their professional and political trajectories, document analysis, and interviews with Peace Corps volunteers and staff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research findings can be of potential used to not-for-profit organizations that rely on altruistically minded volunteers to complete their mission. Specifically, recommendations will be generated that can be used to improve Peace Corps programs, in particular empirical information on patterns of volunteer trajectories. Further, results may possibly be generalizable to some degree to other helping organizations (such as AmeriCorps, Vista, professional activist organizations and NGOs, charitable foundations, and houses of worship). This project has the potential to contribute to a comprehensive theory about the effects of formal organization on the idealism and altruism of the organization's participants. Nurturing altruism has meaningful consequences in the United States, whose democracy turns in large part on the health of its civil society. Would-be volunteers must have faith in the organizations they are joining; this project will provide insights on how to ferment and maintain that faith. Understanding the long-term effects of bureaucracies on idealism is a critical component of managing a successful voluntary, third-sector, and charitable organizations, positive peace, and participatory democracy.</AbstractNarration>
