    <AbstractNarration>This new, catalytic U.S.-Netherlands research collaboration addresses renewable energy-driven smart grids. Renewable energy sources include resources that are regularly replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tidal waves, and geothermal heat. To pursue innovative approaches for managing the uncertainty of renewable energy sources, the U.S. principal investigator (PI) and a graduate student will visit the Netherlands to begin a collaboration with counterparts at the Delft University of Technology, a leader in European smart energy research. There they intend to work together to improve current smart grid technology for better prediction of consumer demand in the face of uncertain power generation, as is often the case in renewable energy systems. If successful, their preliminary results should contribute to improving bidirectional communication between grid operators and consumers. Early results and follow-on research may have broader impact by shaping management strategies through new approaches to modeling consumer energy usage. Success could mean better long-term prediction by employing new artificial intelligence approaches (AI), i.e., smart controls for power grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team expects to identify the challenges posed by the uncertainty of renewable energy generation and begin investigating intelligent methods for meeting these challenges in two priority areas: (a) planning for decentralized power generation and storage, and (b) managing congestion in grids due to asynchrony between renewable energy supply and consumer demand. The PI will work with an experienced team of eminent Dutch researchers in AI, power systems, and technology policy. They will have real operating and energy-use data from a medium voltage grid in Netherlands and intend to start developing scalable algorithms for individual decision making in multi-agent settings. Further, broader impacts are anticipated from this collaboration with an introduction of smart energy systems into research and teaching at the University of Georgia, thereby contributing to training U.S. undergraduate and graduate students in an innovative and rapidly growing energy sector with industrial relevance.</AbstractNarration>
