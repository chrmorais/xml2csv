    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to characterize aerosol particles acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INPs) during wintertime storms along the west coast of the U.S. Specifically the researchers will participate in CalWater-2/ACAPEX field campaign with a combination of ground measurements at Bodega Bay, CA and airborne instruments studying the Atmospheric River (AR) phenomena and the impact of aerosols on wintertime precipitation in the Sierra Mountains of California. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;These ground-based and in situ airborne measurements will improve our fundamental understanding of the role of biological and other aerosol types in enhancing or suppressing orographic precipitation over the western U.S. during winter. A variety of instruments will be used to directly and remotely measure these aerosols. The results should aid the cloud microphysics community through improved understanding of ice formation in clouds at temperatures warmer than -20C. This study will be conducted in collaboration with the Department of Energy (DoE) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) during the CalWater-2 field campaign. The ground- and ship-based data will be combined with airborne data to develop a four-dimensional view of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Ice Nucleating Particle (INP) concentrations. Data sets will be integrated into a description of the influences of these aerosols on winter and early spring precipitation in the Sierra Mountains of California. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the training of Ph.D. students from two universities (Colorado State University and North Carolina State University) using advanced instrumentation including confocal fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. With the ongoing drought in the western United States this study is both timely and critical in advancing our understanding of biological and other aerosol types on wintertime precipitation in the Sierra Mountains. As a major source region of the U.S. food supply, an improved understanding of the role of these aerosols on wintertime precipitation has broad implications on the resulting spring and summer water management policy in California.</AbstractNarration>
