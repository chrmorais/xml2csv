    <AbstractNarration>The I-Corps for Learning project addresses the problem of developing a well-prepared STEM workforce that is crucial to the Nation's health and economy, by laying the foundation for broad implementation of effective instructional practices and advances in education. I-Corps for Learning provides support for teams of educational innovators to accelerate and scale-up novel effective practices in a sustainable manner. Help for teams takes the form of workshops, mentoring, and participation in a cohort of like-minded educational innovators. The I-Corps-L approach attempts to utilize insights gained from bringing product discoveries to market to create an entrepreneurial approach to bringing learning innovations into situations where they can benefit society. Educational innovations in this case applies to developments that address K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research, as well as learning in informal science education environments. In providing organizational and logistical support, the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is collaborating with the I-Corps-L Instructional Team led by Dr. Karl Smith. This project has the potential of helping to achieve the goal of educational transformation through propagation and scale-up of educational innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps for Learning model is centered around participating three-person teams. Team composition includes a principal investigator who has developed an education innovation through prior support from the National Science Foundation, an entrepreneurial lead who is committed to leading the team through the investigation, and a mentor who understands the nature of successful education-focused innovations. Training includes an introductory three-day training session, five online sessions, and a closing two-day training session. This project is designed to fill the gap between educational innovations of proven effectiveness in enhancing student learning and the widespread use of such practices. I-Corps L, is based on a process of hypothesis testing and investigation along with clarification of user needs. This approach can benefit education researchers by helping them to develop ways to broaden the impact of innovations in teaching and learning science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In tandem with its logistical and organizational services ASEE is conducting an evaluation to assess individual sessions within the face-to-face meetings, overall elements of the multi-day training workshops, and handling of meeting logistics. In addition, the participants will answer formative questions throughout the effort to ensure success in meeting workshop objectives, and properly accommodate all aspects associated with the virtual sessions.</AbstractNarration>
