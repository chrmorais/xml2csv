    <AbstractNarration>Interference between wireless devices will become a serious bottleneck for future wireless networks as&lt;br/&gt;they become more pervasive in our everyday lives. The traditional approach of dealing with interference&lt;br/&gt;is to share limited resources, such as spectrum, among many users such that a given resource is used by&lt;br/&gt;only one user at a time. The recent notion of interference alignment (IA) proposes a new paradigm where&lt;br/&gt;several users can simultaneously send information by sharing the same resource. This new approach&lt;br/&gt;results in increased network capacity where every user gets half the interference-free throughput. In this&lt;br/&gt;research, the project team will leverage reconfigurable antenna systems to design and enhance&lt;br/&gt;interference alignment techniques for multi-user wireless networks. Reconfigurable antennas are capable&lt;br/&gt;of electronically switching between different radiation patterns (or 'states') in response to the needs of&lt;br/&gt;the overlying communication link and network. In this regard, reconfigurable antenna systems represent a&lt;br/&gt;significant new degree of freedom for developing interference management techniques. The project team&lt;br/&gt;proposes new ways of using the antennas to enable more practical solutions for future multi-user&lt;br/&gt;networks and also provide a software defined radio platform to enable further research within the&lt;br/&gt;community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the vast majority of existing research in this area considers an antenna to be a monolithic 'black&lt;br/&gt;box', the project team will develop and demonstrate new compact form-factor electronically&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable antenna technologies that are capable of providing pattern agility. This additional degree&lt;br/&gt;of freedom allows for the dynamic selection of radiation patterns to seamlessly integrate with, and extend&lt;br/&gt;interference alignment techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate how electrically reconfigurable&lt;br/&gt;antennas can greatly enhance the sum capacity achieved via distributed interference alignment, especially&lt;br/&gt;at low SNR, by improving the subspace design. The second objective is to demonstrate how blind&lt;br/&gt;interference alignment can be practically achieved by combining antenna state selection algorithms with&lt;br/&gt;multiple physical layer transmission schemes. The additional channel diversity provided by&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable antennas comes with an overhead to acquire information about the state of all the channels,&lt;br/&gt;revealing a need for a strategy to select the optimal state and most importantly an ability to learn the&lt;br/&gt;changes in the channel state in order to adapt. With these goals in mind, the project team will utilize&lt;br/&gt;online learning based on multi-armed bandit theory to design algorithms to control and adapt the state of a&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable antenna system. For the multi-user network, the team will analyze the cost of learning&lt;br/&gt;under an unknown statistical model of the channel and compare it with the oracle with full prior&lt;br/&gt;knowledge. Finally, the team will focus on implementing the developed interference alignment algorithms&lt;br/&gt;on Drexel's Software Defined Communications (SDC) testbed. The SDC testbed is based upon a Scalable&lt;br/&gt;OFDM physical layer, which operates close to many different standards. The project team will develop&lt;br/&gt;new blocks for precoding and decoding, cross-transmitter symbol-timing synchronization, as well as&lt;br/&gt;implement more efficient synchronization techniques that require less data overhead. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;combination of the Drexel SDC testbed with IA algorithms will result in a product that has high relevance&lt;br/&gt;to the industrial and academic research communities. Special effort will be made to not only disseminate&lt;br/&gt;research results through relevant conference and journal publication, but also through testbed technology&lt;br/&gt;demonstrations. In order to extend the outreach of the proposed research beyond the research community,&lt;br/&gt;high school students and teachers, specifically under-represented populations, will be invited to&lt;br/&gt;participate in the PIs research laboratories through pre-existing educational programs. The developed&lt;br/&gt;testbed will be used to develop demonstrations and laboratory-based course modules.</AbstractNarration>
