    <AbstractNarration>This workshop project is designed to bring together dedicated faculty members in Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) from across the USA to share and acquire up-to-date knowledge in a conference format about the most effective strategies for improving retention and graduation rates of Hispanic students majoring in STEM disciplines. Attending will be faculty instructors and administrators from an equal number of 2-year and 4-year HSI institutions. The focus is on successful approaches that have worked for Hispanic students. The conference is covering emerging topics of particular interest to HSIs, including data about outcomes of new approaches that is being disseminated for the first time. The workshop will focus in particular on around high-context educational activities (e.g. internships, co-ops, and research experiences with faculty members as mentors) that students from Hispanic origins find particularly empowering and motivating.</AbstractNarration>
