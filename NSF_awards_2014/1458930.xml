    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) activity within the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the development of research capability at HBCUs that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. HBCU-RISE projects have a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department(s) and the institutional mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity as well as increasing the production of doctoral students in science and engineering. With support from the National Science Foundation, Morgan State University will implement comprehensive strategies designed to transform teaching and learning in an effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in electrical engineering. The project, designed to address vulnerabilities in cyber security, will impact a large population of minority students and provide opportunities for collaboration and career development for faculty. This project has the potential to contribute significantly to the pool of minority electrical engineers trained in technology that is vital to the nation's cyber infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research project is to enhance the security of cyber-physical systems while enhancing the research capability of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Morgan State University by: 1) providing Internet of Things (IoT) device security at the physical layer and countermeasures to prevent attacks and ensure secure data exchange between IoT devices; 2) developing Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty research expertise and increase competitiveness regarding security of IoT devices; 3) enriching the educational and research experience of students; and 4) increasing the production of underrepresented minority students with doctoral degrees in electrical engineering. This project will equip engineering students with innovative techniques vital for tackling challenges in national cyberinfrastructure, develop the institution's research and educational capacity and productivity, and contribute to the institutional transformation. The project is aligned with the institution's strategic goal of enhancing its status as a Doctoral Research University.</AbstractNarration>
