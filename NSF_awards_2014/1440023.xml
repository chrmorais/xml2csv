    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed work is to greatly improve our ability to understand and predict space weather hazards on society in the near-Earth environment.  Specifically, models of the impact of a coronal mass ejection originating from the sun as it interacts with the Earth's ionosphere and atmosphere and lithosphere will be generated.  Applications of this work include:  (1) protecting the electric power grid from blackouts caused by space weather; and (2) maintaining communication capabilities during space weather events. A 2008 National Academies report indicated that extreme space weather events, "though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future."  However, it is clear that the re-occurrence of an 1859-magnitude space weather-driven geomagnetic storm could disrupt modern society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable electrotechnologies (such as power grids and wireless communications).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology of the proposed work involves the application of detailed, high-resolution Maxwell's equations finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide developed by the PI over the past decade.  These three-dimensional (3-D) models will include such details as the Earth's topography, oceans, lithosphere composition, and ionosphere plasma (both small and large-scale structures).  Output data will be location-specific electromagnetic field data that will be used to improve our ability to maintain power grid operations and communications during space weather events.  </AbstractNarration>
