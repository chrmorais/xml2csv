    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Cornell University. The students will work on a range of projects that advance the Laboratory's scientific mission, further their education and training, and heighten their interest in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Although the research scope of this REU program is focused on understanding the fundamental physics of beams and accelerators and the uses of the radiation they produce, the techniques and technologies utilized are applicable to a much wider range of scientific careers. Each student is asked to participate in one of the outreach programs at the Laboratory, teaching them to communicate the scientific ideas with the general public and exposing them to the outreach prospects at their home institutions, through the Student Physical Society (SPS) chapters and other outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cornell Laboratory has an international reputation for research, with a unique constellation of programs including accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation research, and microwave superconductivity. The student participants have full access to the resources of the Laboratory and University, and will work closely with Laboratory experienced researchers. The students will participate in joint activities that include lectures of wide topics in the accelerator physics and X-ray science; take part with a bigger body of REU groups on campus in fun-talks and hands-on activities that introduce various frontiers of physics research; and attend events addressing the social and ethical issues in scientific research and conduct. These joint activities provide an excellent environment for networking of the future scientists.</AbstractNarration>
