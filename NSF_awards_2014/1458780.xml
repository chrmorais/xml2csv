    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the Capitol Technology University will award scholarships to 26 incoming high-need, academically-talented transfer students in an online bachelor's degree program in cybersecurity. The goal of Cyber Transfer Student Program (CTSP) will be to facilitate degree completion in two years for over 70% of program participants. Recruitment will focus on place-bound community college graduates whose college attendance options are limited. By enabling participants to complete a bachelor's degree at a distance, CTSP will increase the number of cybersecurity professionals in the workforce. Many will be minorities and first-generation college students who might not otherwise complete a bachelor's degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capitol faculty and staff will provide pre-matriculation counseling to help potential transfers maximize credit transfer. Academic and student support services for the three cohorts will include an honors seminar, faculty-led activities, and a multi-faceted mentoring and advising program. Online student support services and extracurricular experiences, combined with synchronous online curricular delivery and scholarship support, will provide a supportive and engaging environment for students while removing the distractions of financial need. Ongoing assessment of progress towards project goals will help contribute to the knowledge base regarding the role efforts such as this play in improving STEM degree attainment of financially disadvantaged students.</AbstractNarration>
