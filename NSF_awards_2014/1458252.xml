    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of San Diego (USD) will support, and retain a diverse group of mathematics, computer science, physics and biophysics majors. The project will recruit broadly for participants including those from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds in STEM, by building on the results of a previous NSF S-STEM project. The data obtained from both projects will lead to successful recruitment, retention, and academic success of disadvantaged and underrepresented groups in STEM at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will fund two nine-student cohorts. Students who exhibit interest and talent in the identified areas during their first year in college will be encouraged to apply to join a cohort and receive financial and other support for three subsequent years. The S-STEM scholars will be extensively mentored throughout their undergraduate experience by project faculty, and will regularly participate in STEM enrichment and community-building activities. Scholars will take a one-unit course, especially designed by project faculty, to develop the communication skills and interdisciplinary-thinking strategies required to be successful while in school and after graduation. The program will establish several high-impact practices leading to student success that will be continued at USD beyond the duration of the project, and shared with other universities through publications and presentations.</AbstractNarration>
