    <AbstractNarration>1443446&lt;br/&gt;Lancaster&lt;br/&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests funds to conduct the next triennial National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) review. A review of the overall progress of the NNI is an important element of delivering on the scientific and societal benefit nanotechnology has to offer. The review committee will be a blend of academia, private sector, business community members (large and small), and members able to represent the growing community of those concerned about the ethical, legal and societal aspects of nanotechnology. Emphasis will be placed on delivering a balanced review of the science needed for basic discovery, and the science needed for execution at the application phase; namely, moving toward commercialization in a responsible manner. Progress in developing good science that supports the needs of policy makers and regulatory agencies should be an area for investigation. Results from research agencies that support commercialization, and how to evaluate the impact of that research would be a welcome and much needed component of this review. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed intellectual merit is to build upon the findings from the 2013 review. The focus will be on (1) the NNI signature initiatives as they relate to commercialization and (2) nanotechnology physical and human infrastructure needs. In addition to advancing fundamental research, the NNI user facilities are a driver for nanotechnology commercialization. Better coordination among the facilities, and potentially the introduction of new facilities dedicated to nanotechnology material characterization, should be explored further. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact from nanotechnology arises from its potential to significantly transform numerous fields, including information technology, aerospace, agriculture, energy, homeland security, environment, healthcare, national defense, and transportation systems. This next triennial NNI review will produce feedback to the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology Subcommittee and the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office in order to even more effectively serve the Nanotechnology community in the near future.</AbstractNarration>
