    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change on living systems in the US requires scientists and natural resource managers be informed about processes operating across multiple time and space scales. New remote sensing technologies and multi-scale research approaches are providing relevant data simultaneously at the centimeter to kilometer scale. Historic data at key research sites allow for analyses of complex data on the second to decadal scales. New approaches are needed to combine and transform these data into useful and easy to understand information using user-friendly tools to explore the data. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is beginning to deliver ground based and remotely sensed data at key locations throughout the US specifically designed to evaluate the effects of climate change on living systems. The basic goal of this EAGER proposal is to design and develop advanced remote sensing data products from data that will be available from NEON and make their application easier for a wide range of potential scientists and decision-makers. Data will be accessible and ready-for-use by removing the need to perform tedious preliminary processing and analysis tasks of raw remote-sensing data. These advanced data products will also prove useful and understandable to non-remote sensing scientists, which will increase their utilization and applications to NEON?s grand challenges. A team of experienced ecologists who are aware of data needs and key applications will be assembled to design and select these final data products. Case studies, using NEON's Airborne Observatory Platform and AOP-like data in combination with a time series of existing remote-sensing data in Yellowstone National Park's Northern Range, will be conducted to demonstrate the utility of these data products for ecological analyses, modeling and key research questions regarding ecological forecasting.</AbstractNarration>
