    <AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for the 21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2015)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the attendance of students to the 21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2015), to be hosted on February 7-11th, 2015 in the Bay Area, California. The HPCA Symposium, a top-tier conference on computer architecture related research, has enjoyed a rich history of success. The research results presented at HPCA conferences have had strong impacts in this research field and are highly regarded among the computer architecture community. Students have much to gain from attending HPCA. For example, they will learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>
