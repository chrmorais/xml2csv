    <AbstractNarration>Santorini is an active arc volcano associated with the Mediterranean subduction zone, which accomodates tectonic convergence between Africa and Europe. Santorini recently experienced geologic unrest and this study will document the current distribution of subsurface magma. Because the volcanic system is semi submerged Santorini is an ideal site for detailed imaging using marine instrumentation. Onshore-only studies cannot achieve broad enough aperture or dense enough coverag to allow mapping of magma throughout the crust. By determining the physical properties of the crust, this international team from the U.S., U.K., and Greece, seek to understand how magma at different depths crystallizes and what that might imply about both a basic research question- how does crust that eventually makes up continents form, and a geohazard question- does the current distribution of magma indicate a likelihood of sustained volcano inflation that might precede a major eruption? A US student will gain seismic data acquisition experience and training in state-of-the-art processing methods, while also learning to work within an international research team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismic imaging of the crust at Santorini volcano is designed to constrain the distribution of subseafloor magma and any variation in extent of apparent degree of crystallization with depth. This site is viewed as representative of silicic arc volcanoes worldwide, so results could be representative of other arc volcanoes. Ocean bottom seismometers, and land seismometers will be deployed for a few-week field experiment. Active source signals will be recorded by these instruments as well as by a towed, multi-channel streamer. Tracklines laid out along a north-east trending, 10 x 50 mile swath, with Santorini at the center, will be image the lower crustal structure with unprecedented resolution. Data analysis emphasizes complementary seismic approaches: (1) Dense 3D isotropic and anisotropic travel time tomography (2) Full waveform inversion tomography and waveform modeling to obtain higher resolution and more accurate elastic properties and their spatial variability.</AbstractNarration>
