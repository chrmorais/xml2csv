    <AbstractNarration>Most natural language processing (NLP) systems still have only a literal understanding of words and phrases. In particular, current NLP technology is oblivious to the psychological impact that events and situations have on people. For example, NLP systems can recognize phrases associated with being hired or fired, but they do not understand that being hired is usually desirable while being fired is generally undesirable. This exploratory research aims to endow NLP technology with the ability to recognize events and situations that will have a positive or negative impact on people. The proposed research could be transformative because it would enable a fundamentally deeper understanding of language beyond the literal meaning of words and phrases. New methods resulting from this research would benefit a wide spectrum of applications that require understanding of written texts and human conversation, document summarization, question answering, sarcasm recognition, and identification of threatening statements. Society could also benefit from this technology through new opportunities to automatically harvest knowledge from the Web and social media about the events and personal situations that most frequently affect different types of people. Recognizing affective states could help to identify at-risk individuals who may be a danger to themselves or others, such as teenagers who are being bullied, veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, young adults who feel angry or disenfranchised, and elderly people who may be lonely and depressed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research investigates novel methods for learning to recognize "affective" events and situations in text. Affect state recognition is essential to understand people's motivations, plans and goals, causal chains, and the narrative structure of text and conversation. The goal of this research is to create weakly supervised learning methods to automatically identify phrases corresponding to affective events and situations that have a positive or negative impact on people. This research aims to develop a set of independent, weakly supervised learners, where each component will exploit a specific type of linguistic structure and discourse context to identify events and situations that are associated with positive or negative affect states. The set of weakly supervised learners will then be embedded in an ensemble architecture, and multi-view learning methods will be explored to enable large-scale bootstrapped knowledge acquisition across the set of independent learners. Key aspects of this work explore different types of linguistic and discourse structures for bootstrapped learning, different approaches for learning multi-word expressions for events and situations, and different methods for handling contextual ambiguity during both learning and recognition. Lexical affect stateknowledge would improve the ability of NLP systems to recognize sarcasm, identify threats, recognize causal relationships, and achieve a deeper understanding of narrative text and conversational dialogue.</AbstractNarration>
