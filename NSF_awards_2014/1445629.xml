    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Free Boundary Problems and Applications," held at the University of Pittsburgh on March 11-14, 2015. Free boundaries in mathematical models (interfaces, moving boundaries, shocks, and so on) arise in a wide range of applications in various sciences and real world problems, including gas dynamics, material sciences, geometry, complex fluids, water waves, phase transitions, mathematical finance, mathematical biology, and medicine. The breadth of the free boundary problems presents challenges and opportunities, and also leads to the development of research in different directions with unifying themes regarding methods and techniques. The aim of the conference is to bring together leading experts in various theoretical and applied aspects of free boundary problems to promote and enhance those unifying techniques, in particular, to exchange and explore ideas, to establish new connections, to foster new collaborations, and to provide training for students and junior researchers. Leading experts will speak in the conference. The program of the conference will be structured to foster integration of research and education, and to broaden opportunities and enable the participation of members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of free boundary problems has become an important aspect of nonlinear partial differential equations. Modern approaches to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations have brought various new insights and new methods to understand the free boundary problems. New important and challenging problems have been emerging in physics, engineering, industry, material sciences, finance, biology and medicine, and other fields. The conference provides an opportunity for experts in analysis and applications to present their research results, discuss mathematical theory and techniques critical for many research fields and applications, explore new important and challenging problems emerging in various applications, establish new connections, and potentially foster new collaborations among the participants. The conference also provides an opportunity for students and junior researchers, including those from the groups underrepresented in mathematical sciences (women, minorities) to be educated in the research field and to present their recent research results. The conference will disseminate research results and promote the research area through talks, a web page, flyers, and posters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: www.math.pitt.edu/~dwang/conference2015.html</AbstractNarration>
