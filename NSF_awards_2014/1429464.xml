    <AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring a CRAY XC-30 HPC Cluster, supports the NCAT Research Computing, Education and Outreach. NCAT is requesting this support for the Research Computing Consortium of the Sciences, Engineering and Technology (ReCoSETC). This system will expand both the capacity and capability of high performance Computing (HPC) at NCAT by increasing the number of CPU cores, memory and disk, and adding a much needed GPGPU capability for applications ranging from computer algebra systems to large scale modeling, simulations, and database processing. This instrument will impact research advances in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Biology, Education, Outreach and Training, Numerical Weather Forecasting (NWF), GIS analysis, Acoustics, Nuclear and Particle Physics. In addition, this cluster will be a significant enhancement for the current ongoing research activities at NCAT including: material science, nano-engineering, weather modeling and the collaborative development of research training and education. The acquisition supports the following projects:&lt;br/&gt;- Variable Star Identification and Modeling &lt;br/&gt;- In Silico Investigation on the Potential of Novel Porous Materials for Olefin and Paraffin Separation for Potential Use in Petroleum Refining Processes&lt;br/&gt;- Modeling and Simulation of Complex Biological Systems &lt;br/&gt;- Investigation of the Origin, Formation, and Propagation of the Pre-Tropical Cyclone African Easterly Waves and Mesoscale Convective Systems &lt;br/&gt;- The Dynamics and Predictions of Orographic Rainfall Associated with Landfalling Hurricanes&lt;br/&gt;- Ancillary Research Projects;&lt;br/&gt;- Outreach to K-12 and the Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation supports researchers and their external collaborators in diverse data-intensive science fields such as engineering, atmospheric sciences, energy and environmental systems, physics, biology and bioengineering education and outreach. As a leading producer of African-American baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree-holding engineers, this integrated research instrument will serve as a focal point to promote future collaborations with other academic institutions working on various research topics. This instrument is expected to strengthen education training activities by enabling innovative cross-disciplinary courses and promoting its education outreach activity with K-12 teachers and students. The proposed research at NCAT will promote a seamless integration of intellectual activity with outreach at all levels.</AbstractNarration>
