    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project will support participation of Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) of pioneers in a Symposium to be held on September 7, 2014 at the High Country Conference Center, Flagstaff, Arizona. This special Symposium will precede the International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy, which will take place from September 8 to 12, 2014. The MBE conference has taken place since 1978 and has provided a prominent international forum for reporting new developments in the areas of fundamental and applied molecular beam epitaxy research.. The Symposium will foster advances in the leading research on III-V semiconductors, by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. The program provides the opportunity to learn about the latest developments in fundamental and applied MBE research, synthesis of new materials, formation of novel heterostructures, and the development of innovative devices. III-V, II-VI, IV-VI and IV semiconductors are addressed including wide bandgap materials, nanowires and quantum dots and various other novel devices. Technological advances of the semiconductors addressed in the Symposium offer the means to meet the increasing demand for higher performance devices with multiple functionalities, in support of communications and sensing applications. Further dissemination will be provided with a presentation of Symposium papers in the Journal of Crystal Growth.</AbstractNarration>
