    <AbstractNarration>This project wants to capitalize on a team of robots that move in order to better sense the environment and then perform basic manipulation tasks. The vision of the project is to integrate robots easily, provide human-team interfaces, and develop manipulation algorithms. The research will involve the development of perception strategies and manipulation schemes that will allow operation of the robot teams in real-world environments during search and rescue missions. In addition, this research will involve working in cluttered scenes where the lighting conditions may not be ideal. The project addresses: (i) Research on the novel problem of robotic perception and manipulation of target objects that interact with other objects as an integral part of the environment, which cannot be fully isolated in views and in physical arrangements before being manipulated; (ii) An appearance-based approach for recognition and pose estimation of 3D objects in cluttered scenes from a single view; (iii) Development of a measure of scene recognizability from each viewpoint to evaluate how accurately partially-occluded objects are recognized and how well their poses are estimated; (iv) Creation of solutions for disassembly analysis of 3D structures, extending our preliminary analysis of 2D structures; (v) Development of grasping based on the results of perception and with the aid of stability analysis of the arrangement of the objects and their interaction with the environment and with one another; and (vi) Experimental validation of the system in real-world settings, in close consultation with our industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will allow the creation of manipulation capabilities along with perception schemes to facilitate the development of a multi-robot team for search and rescue missions. The impacts of the project include: (i) Expansion of the annual robot summer camp to include robot-team activities with the objective of attracting middle-schoolers from under-represented groups to computer science/electrical engineering; (ii) Integration of the activities with first responders through the UPenn and UNC Charlotte collaborations; (ii) Experimental validation in SAFL at UMN and the Disaster City in TX; (iii) Offering project themes to REU undergraduates or to the UROP program; (iv) Outreach programs that involve demonstrations to local K-12 institutions; and (v) Inclusion of the project theme to the regular curricula.</AbstractNarration>
