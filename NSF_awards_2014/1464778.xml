    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting Professor Marisa C. Kozlowski of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania to explore the development of methods for the formation of C-C, C-N, and C-O bonds by oxidative coupling reactions. The formation of such bonds by facile oxidative transformations is a well-recognized process in biological systems. Such routes often introduce functionality at non-functionalized centers, thereby eliminating the need for complex pre-functionalized starting materials. To achieve these goals, individual reaction steps will be studied using stoichiometric conditions in order to understand the principles governing novel reactivity and selectivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemistry studied will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as oxygen is used as the terminal oxidizing agent in combination with less toxic and less expensive base metals. Successful development of the methodology will have a broad impact as there is an important need for synthetic methods in areas ranging from the pharmaceutical, chemical, materials science, and agricultural industries to basic biological and chemical research endeavors. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Broadening the participation of underrepresented populations in chemistry research is a particular focus with support for the newly established Association for Cultural Diversity (ACDC) in Chemistry at Penn. This organization is a chapter of the National Consortium for Diversity in Science and Engineering with the mission of promoting diversity of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields at Penn and surrounding universities.</AbstractNarration>
