    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of this 3-year project is to investigate the thermal and magnetic structure of sunspots by using simultaneous high-resolution observations of magnetic field and mass motion at different heights in the solar atmosphere. The project will shed more light on four major science topics, namely: (i) three dimensional magnetic structure of sunspots; (ii) three dimensional thermal structure of sunspot; (iii) effect of magnetic field on spectral line profiles; and, (iv) magnetic and velocity structure near solar flare locations. The first three topics also have broader implications to stellar astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project includes observations of the Sun that have application to space weather, stellar astrophysics, and training of both undergraduate and graduate students to becoming the next generation of solar physicists. In particular, this 3-year project will: (i) enable better understanding of the magnetic field structure of Sun-like stars and their chromospheric activity; (ii) provide improved understanding of the magnetic field, mass motion, and thermal structure of active region chromospheres to help identify unstable magnetic configurations that may impact space weather; (iii) help identify specific science problems for which the higher spatial resolution of the future DKIST will be crucial; and, (iv) contribute to educating undergraduate and graduate students in observational solar physics. The project will involve undergraduate students from the California State University at Northridge, which is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution, as well as an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution. The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
