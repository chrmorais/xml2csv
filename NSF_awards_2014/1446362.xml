    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 2014 ACM UbiComp International Workshop on Smart Health Systems and Applications (SmartHealthSys 2014), which will be held in Seattle, Washington, on September 14, 2014. The SmartHealthSys workshop is a forum for researchers and developers from academia and industry in the area of smart health to present results and discuss ways to advance the field. The workshop focuses on wireless, connected, and mobile health research as a multidisciplinary area spanning computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, nursing, medicine, and public health. The workshop includes presentations of theoretical and experimental research, prototyping efforts, case studies and advances in technology related to smart health systems, applications, and services. In addition to traditional topics in this area, the workshop features a special focus on scalable smart health. This topic area aims tdiscuss and present innovations that address challenges associated with large-scale adoption of smart health technologies in end-user settings and uncontrolled environments. Papers accepted to the SmartHealthSys workshop will be published in the UbiComp 2014 Adjunct Proceedings and included in the ACM Digital Library. A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important and emerging area and represents an investment by NSF in the integration of research and education.</AbstractNarration>
