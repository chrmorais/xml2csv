    <AbstractNarration>This award funds a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Missouri University of Science and Technology. Each summer a cohort of undergraduate students will work with faculty in small groups to design, implement, and evaluate research projects involving secure cloud computing, an emerging research area that is current and important to our national interests. The research projects involve security, trust, and privacy in cloud computing. The use of secure cloud technology offers an effective means for establishing secure cyberinfrastructures to develop a wide variety of applications that are used by citizens and that support our technology-based society. Thus the students and researchers have the opportunity to explore problems that are important and timely and relevant to all our citizens. This project builds human capacity in computing and communications research and knowledge. The program will provide experiences to undergraduate students that may influence their choices about further education and future careers and continue to give them confidence to pursue these choices and thus increase the size and diversity of the scientific workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site will focus on recruiting females and students from groups under-represented in computing fields as well as students from 2 and 4 year institutions. The students will participate in professional development activities that make them more aware of graduate school and professional aspects of a computing career. The students will be able to use the state-of-the-art facilities available at the university and interact with faculty mentors to conduct challenging and timely research on emerging technologies fundamental to developing trustworthy systems for the future.</AbstractNarration>
