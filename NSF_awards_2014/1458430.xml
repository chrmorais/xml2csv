    <AbstractNarration>The College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS) at the University of New Hampshire Durham will collaborate with the Community College System of New Hampshire to enhance emerging state and national initiatives, improve alignment between community colleges and four-year institutions, and increase the numbers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates. This scholarship program will be designed to provide community college transfers the level of commitment necessary for their success through scholarships to meet financial need, assertive and pro-active advising during their entire university career, and a classroom and research based cohort-building seminar experience. The high level of initial engagement is critical to overcome transfer shock, which is reported in the literature and reflected in university statistics; however engagement of the scholars in on-campus activities until graduation is planned. The project will increase learning opportunities through the proactive engagement of community college and university faculty and improve teaching methods via engagement with the STEM Pedagogy Academy. Due to the nature of the institutions involved, the project will increase the diversity of university STEM graduates. Lessons learned from these efforts will be incorporated into state planning and can be replicated by other state universities partnering with state community college systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project activities will: (1) expose community college students to the STEM research enterprise and generate applications from community college students intending to major in CEPS disciplines; (2) increase retention, academic performance, and graduation rates among community college students transferring to the CEPS; (3) prepare scholars for career placement in the STEM workforce and/or further studies in STEM disciplines; and (4) provide university and community college faculty with the necessary resources to effectively teach, advise, and mentor community college transfer students. To address the project objectives, in addition to financial support, the project will provide the following student support services and programs: (1) structured and on-going academic support, advising, and mentoring; (2) an introduction to STEM culture and university academic resources, community building activities, research experiences, career preparation, and counseling through the cohort experience of a special seminar course for community college transfers; (3) academic support regarding cognitively-based study skills and study skills instruction; (4) support to encourage faculty to undertake better student learning practices through the STEM Pedagogy Academy; and (5) exposure to research and careers in STEM disciplines in introductory courses at the community colleges.</AbstractNarration>
