    <AbstractNarration>The majority of our knowledge of the astronomical world is derived from the emission, absorption,&lt;br/&gt;and scattering of electromagnetic radiation from atoms and molecules. The astronomical observations&lt;br/&gt;of atomic and molecular spectra including transition energies, intensities, and light polarization&lt;br/&gt;complemented with laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations are essential in the study of&lt;br/&gt;stellar atmospheres. The goal of this CNIC proposal is to catalyze an international interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between the group of Prof. Ludwik Adamowicz, at the Department of Chemistry&lt;br/&gt;and Biochemistry, the University of Arizona (USA) and Prof. Jow-Tsong Shy, at the Department&lt;br/&gt;of Physics, the National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan) on performing very accurate experimental&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical studies of the rovibrational (rovib) spectra of small hydrogen-containing molecules&lt;br/&gt;and clusters. These systems constitute a significant portion of the mass of the universe and are&lt;br/&gt;key to the interstellar chemistry. The goal of this collaborative is to characterize and assign the&lt;br/&gt;rovibrational spectra of the studied molecular systems. The obtained data can be very helpful in&lt;br/&gt;identifying spectral lines recorded by telescopes and assigning these lines to particular molecules and&lt;br/&gt;clusters. As a result, knowledge will be gained about the compositions of various domains in the&lt;br/&gt;universe and about chemistry occurring there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration brings together groups with very different research profiles. The Taiwan&lt;br/&gt;group has been concerned with high-precision experimental spectroscopy studies of small neutral and&lt;br/&gt;charged molecular systems. The theoretical-chemistry Arizona group has been involved in development&lt;br/&gt;and application of very accurate quantum-mechanical methods for calculating spectra of small atoms&lt;br/&gt;and molecules. Both groups are accomplished in their respective fields. In this project, the theory&lt;br/&gt;and the experiment will be combined in elucidation of the spectra of molecules and clusters involving&lt;br/&gt;hydrogen and its isotopes. The studies are very fundamental in nature and as such they are well&lt;br/&gt;suited for NSF funding.</AbstractNarration>
