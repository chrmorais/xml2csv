    <AbstractNarration>Washington State University, the University of Montana, the University of Idaho and Montana State University will collaborate to create the Pacific Northwest Alliance: Collaborative Opportunities for Success in Mentoring of Students (PNW-COSMOS). These alliance schools will also partner with Salish Kootenai College, Montana Tech of the University of Montana, and Heritage University. This project was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 14-505) for the AGEP-Transformation (AGEP-T) track. The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for URMs. The PNW-COSMOS project will develop, implement, and study a model of STEM graduate education focusing on underrepresented minorities (URMs), specifically those who are American Indians (AIs) and Native Alaskans (NAs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed AGEP-T project will be unique and will have potential to contribute to foundational knowledge about the recruitment, retention and graduation of doctoral AIs and NAs in STEM. The emphasis on culturally-relevant and culturally-immersive activities is a unique intervention approach for graduate students and their mentoring faculty in STEM; and what happens in this project may provide results that transform the way the field engages and works with URM graduate students in rural environments and in regions of the country where there are high percentages of AI and AN students. The lessons learned as this project progresses, and the ultimate results from the work, will provide information that will be beneficial to educators, administrators and policymakers, as well as the general public.</AbstractNarration>
