    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating research on nanoscale bioelectronics to fill the need for cost-effective biosensor systems that quickly, sensitively, and accurately measure concentrations of important compounds. The amplified bioelectronic sensor platform being developed is important because it offers an unprecedented combination of performance properties, versatility, and customizability. By varying the architecture and recognition molecules in the sensing interface, a broad range of commercially important biosensor systems could be developed for applications including screening for therapeutic agents, measurement of toxins and pathogens in food and environmental samples, point-of-care testing of biological samples, and real-time, on-site detection of chemical warfare agents for military and homeland-security applications. The project will result in prototype amplified bioelectronic sensors suitable for three types of commercial biosensor systems: portable point-of-care meters, electrochemical multiwell plates, and flow-injection analyzers. This patented bioelectronic sensor platform has the following features: (1) multiple signal-amplification mechanisms, (2) multiple types of biological recognition molecules, (3) compatibility with multiple commercial biosensor systems, and (4) disposable sensing units. These features provide the following advantages: enhanced sensitivity, versatility, user-friendliness, convenience, and cost-effectiveness when compared to the leading competing biosensor technologies in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Commercial biosensors are needed to measure organophosphate (OP) compounds that target the human enzyme neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and lead to catastrophic neurological disorders. Such biosensors would need to measure NTE activity rapidly and sensitively. The patented amplified bioelectronic sensor achieves this goal by using a reaction pathway to convert NTE?s esterase activity into an electronic signal and using a redox cycle to amplify the signal. However, technology gaps must be addressed to adapt the bioelectronic sensor interface to widely used commercial biosensor systems and to extend the underlying molecular sensing mechanisms to a wide range of other important compounds. These technology gaps will be addressed by (1) exploiting an enzyme-antibody linkage that translates antibody-antigen binding events into a chemical reaction flux, (2) integrating a redox cycle that converts the chemical reaction flux into an electric current and simultaneously amplifies the current, and (3) incorporating conductive nanomaterials that massively increase the sensor?s signal. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a Ph.D. student and undergraduates, will receive innovation and technology-translation experiences through participation in virtually all aspects of the research, including entrepreneurial/innovation discussions and activities. The PI will also provide training in entrepreneurship/innovation to students taking the Multidisciplinary Bioprocessing Laboratory (MBL) course he developed with NSF funding. The MBL course incorporates research into education and teaches students from multiple departments to work effectively in multidisciplinary research teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Conductive Technologies, Inc., a leader in developing and manufacturing electrochemical devices for sensing commercially important analytes, to support the research effort by providing technical expertise in designing and developing electrochemical platforms as well as providing samples of printed electrodes to demonstrate biosensor performance. The project also engages MSU Technologies, the intellectual-property unit of Michigan State University, to help guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
