    <AbstractNarration>Northwestern University proposes a strategy to introduce all students to computational thinking (CT) skills in a context that highlights the value and relevance of computational methods. The Computational Thinking for All (CT4ALL) approach embeds activities in existing high school science and mathematics classrooms as a way to (a) enhance students' CT skills, (b) infuse modern, computational practices of STEM professionals into existing STEM courses, and (c) broaden the appeal of computing by concretely demonstrating its applicability to diverse fields. The project staff have forged a strong partnership with Chicago Public Schools who are embarking on a district-wide effort to infuse computer science into all of their schools. CT4ALL complements this strategy. The project will work intensively with two schools, both serving predominantly low-income, minority populations. The intended outcome is to develop and share practical knowledge of these implementations working within the substantial constraints of large, resource-limited public high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern will analyze data gathered from student attitude questionnaires, student learning assessments, students' work on capstone projects and teacher attitude surveys to inform this study The project will use a Design Based Implementation Research study to develop and refine a whole-school model of this concept that is guided by the following research questions:&lt;br/&gt;(1) what are the CT learning gains for students in the schools;&lt;br/&gt;(2) how do students' attitudes toward CT change, particularly for girls and other traditionally underrepresented groups;&lt;br/&gt;(3) what are the CT learning gains for the STEM teachers; and&lt;br/&gt;(4) to what extent to teachers' confidence, interest, and attitudes towards CT change as a result of their participation?</AbstractNarration>
