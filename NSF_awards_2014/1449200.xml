    <AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will appoint an ad hoc committee, under the auspices of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) of the National Research Council (NRC), to provide a scientific assessment of the current state of knowledge in atmospheric chemistry. The charge of this committee is to identify priorities and strategic steps forward for atmospheric chemistry research for the next decade, in the context of the current state of knowledge, ongoing research activities, and resource availability. Atmospheric chemistry research is critical for improving knowledge about the role of the atmosphere in the Earth system through a better understanding of atmospheric influences on the carbon, nitrogen, energy, and water cycles of Earth, and on air quality and climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appointed ad hoc committee will be responsible for gathering and reviewing relevant literature, providing opportunities for input from a range of relevant stakeholders, and using its expert judgment to synthesize this information into a final consensus report. The committee and its report will be subject to all standard NAS/NRC appointment, operating, and review procedures, and to Section 15 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) that includes requirements regarding public access and conflicts of interest that are applicable to agreements under which the NAS, using a committee, provides advice or recommendations to a Federal agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this effort include an increased awareness by scientific and policy communities and the public of the importance of atmospheric chemistry in developing an improved understanding of the Earth?s climate, air quality, and biogeochemical cycles. The primary audiences for this project include the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the United States Congress, and other U.S. federal agencies that support atmospheric chemistry research.</AbstractNarration>
