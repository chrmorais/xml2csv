    <AbstractNarration>Fifty undergraduate students (10 per year for five years) will be recruited to participate in a 10-week summer residential research experience in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. Their research will include understanding and prediction of weather, climate, and air pollution. Established partnerships with a network of minority-serving undergraduate institutions will be used to ensure that participating students are recruited from a broad range of demographics representing the US population, including groups that have previously been underrepresented in meteorology and atmospheric science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU participants will go through the full research process of choosing a topic, developing a research idea, conducting a literature review, writing a final report, and giving a presentation in a conference setting. The culmination of the summer research experience is a symposium where REU participants will present a scientific poster and give an oral presentation on their summer research projects. By the conclusion of the summer research program participants will be well prepared to conduct scientific research, have a deeper understanding of the graduate school experience. Through the REU Site, students will establish a network of individuals and mentors, who will not only be future resources, but mentors who will play an important role in the development of participants as scientists.</AbstractNarration>
