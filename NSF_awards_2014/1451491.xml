    <AbstractNarration>This project is supporting the first in-person meeting of the Global Learning Council (GLC). Started in 2013, the GLC includes members from industry, academia, non-profits, and government. At this conference they will discuss technology-enhanced learning, focused on the application of learning science to the development of learning tools, data on learning gains, and the science of how students learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific conference sessions include a) Best Practices, b) Big Data, and c) K-16. Working groups will focus on additional topics such as a) funding for educational research in the era of online courses and other technology-enhanced learning tools, and b) policy challenges related to scaling research-driven outcome-based learning. The conference will lead to several deliverables which include case studies that demonstrate the importance of data in improving technology enhanced learning, recommendations on the next steps and processes in using student outcome data across different sectors (such as educational, workforce, company, and philanthropic), announcement of a new collection of learning outcome data donated by a number of the institutions represented in the GLC, the announcement of a set of tools that make learning analytics accessible to an increasing number of the stakeholders involved in the development and dissemination of effective teaching. These and other deliverables will be made available through the Global Learning Council site and the site for the Simons Initiative at Carnegie Mellon. Conference attendees will provide evaluation feedback. This project is funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education through the IUSE program.</AbstractNarration>
