    <AbstractNarration>The University of Florida's Human-Centered Computing Scholars (HCCS) program supports ten financially disadvantaged doctoral students in its College of Engineering. The Scholars conduct research in Human-Centered Computing and work on projects related to accessibility, biometrics, virtual humans, virtual reality, educational technologies, information technology policy and social computing. During the summer months, the project also supports two undergraduate researchers who work in teams with and are mentored by the doctoral students. Each doctoral Scholar is also given an opportunity to participate in a summer internship with a government or industrial research lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human-Centered Computing Scholars are recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other universities in cooperation with the Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing Sciences (iAAMCS). The project is intended to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, primarily African-Americans, through engagement in research and mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
