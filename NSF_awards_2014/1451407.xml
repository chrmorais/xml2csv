    <AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for the CGO 2015 and PPoPP 2015 Symposia &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to two co-located conferences: the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2015) and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2015). The symposia will be held in San Francisco, California, in February 2015. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of compilers and parallel programming. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>
