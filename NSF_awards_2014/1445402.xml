    <AbstractNarration>This week-long symposium is designed to help develop a long-term, collegial peer network of young polar researchers (those within 5 years of receiving their doctorates) who would benefit from mentoring and other interactions with established polar scholars through a common experience at a symposium. Participants also will receive an introduction to communication, team-building and leadership skills, and elements of interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;The organizers expect to develop a core cadre of approximately 30 young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed symposium would build upon, and also act as a follow-on to, a similar symposium organized by the PI?s during the International Polar Year, the "IPY: Next Generation Polar Research (IPY NGPR) Symposium".</AbstractNarration>
