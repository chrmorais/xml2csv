    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for students wishing to attend the 2014 Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) conference, which is to be held in Broomfield, Colorado, from Oct 6-8, 2014. OSDI is the leading international conference on both research and industrial innovations in the field of computer systems, which includes operating systems, mobile computing, distributed systems, file systems, computer security and reliability, and the management and debugging of complex computer systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports up to 30 US-based graduate students to attend and participate in the conference, to learn about the latest research directions, and to meet and discuss their research with leading experts in the field. Students have an opportunity to participate in workshops on special topics or on workshops intended to support students with diverse backgrounds, to present research posters and/or talks, and to volunteer as scribes for the conference sessions. This grant support enables attendance of students who would not otherwise have been able to attend.</AbstractNarration>
