    <AbstractNarration>PI: Bischof, John C. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1461717&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this award is to provide support for the 2015 ASME Fourth Global Congress on Nanoengineering for Medicine and Biology (NEMB). The congress will take place on April 19 - 22, 2015, in Minneapolis, MN at the University of Minnesota. The broader significance and importance of this congress is expanding the participation beyond the existing American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) to foster interdisciplinary research and education. A particular goal is to involve students and other young postdoctoral and faculty in this exciting area of research, including underrepresented groups. There will be numerous networking opportunities generated through this award that will stimulate scientific and technical discussion with and amongst younger generation engineers and scientists and opportunities to mingle with senior investigators. Specific broad impact enhancements to previous NEMB meetings, and other meetings include: more unstructured time for interactions between students and faculty; the opportunity for fast-track publications (special issues in numerous journals - one per track); an array of topical workshops including one on early career development, one on translation of nanotechnology out of the University; and a panel discussion on the changing landscape of scientific publication at the nanoengineering-biomedical interface. This award is being made jointly by five Programs: (1) Biomedical Engineering, (2) Biophotonics, (3) Fluid Dynamics, (4) Particulate and Multiphase Processes, and (5) Thermal Transport Processes, all in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This congress will bring together leading experts in biology, medicine, nano-materials, and engineering so as to review experimental methods, synthetic methods, results, models, computations, analyses and innovative methodologies for sensing, quantifying, diagnosing and treating medical disorders for improved healthcare using engineering approaches. The combination of engineering and biology with a strong focus in medicine will be a hallmark of the planned event. To achieve this the investigators will actively involve a large community of participants, and provide an exciting forum to exemplify the intellectual merit of biosensing, biotransport, biomechanics and other bioengineering in the solution of pressing problems in biology and medicine. Specific research tracks include: (1) nano-imaging and nano-photonics; (2) nano-therapeutics; (3) nano and microfluidics; (4) nano-to-macro: multiscale modeling; (5) nanotoxicology and public health in the environment; and (6) biomimetic materials and nanoscale analysis of living systems. The funding from this proposal will support registration fees for the best student participants, provide funding for student awards (oral and poster presentations), support invited keynote speakers and fund didactic workshops. These activities will provide many opportunities for young researchers to broaden the impact of NEMB 2015. Further outcomes will include the website (http://www.asmeconferences.org/NEMB2015/), online accessible abstracts, selected plenary talks (webcast online), and podcasts of interviews with participants.</AbstractNarration>
