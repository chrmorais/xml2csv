    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supercomputing (SC), the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis is an annual event established in 1988 by the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society. In 2012, approximately 10,000 people participated in the conference. The conference attracts students and professionals from computer and computational science fields from throughout the world with a large concentration of participants from the United States. The conference has been located in a variety of U.S. locations most recently in 2013 in Denver, Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past 13 years, the SC conference series committee has reached out to people in the U.S. who have been traditionally under-represented in the main tracks of SC (African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, women, and people with disabilities), initially through the Minority Serving Institution, then the Minority Outreach and since 2007 the Broader Engagement (BE) programs. The BE program has enjoyed a successful track record at introducing High Performance Computing and related technologies to a wide audience. The program's recent focus has been to build a stronger bridge between the broader engagement program and the SC main technical track, thus strengthening the SC commitment to reaching out to underrepresented groups by promoting their full participation in main tracks of the SC conference series, advancing their professional preparation, and providing important experiences presenting research at a major conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will enable past BE participants to become more involved with the main technical track of the conference by providing training for their submission to the technical program poster session. Past Broader Engagement participants will be encouraged to submit proposals for participation in this two-day workshop. The workshop will include training and discussion on how to organize research results, on available SC resources and on successful poster submission and, consequently, a successful poster presentation. The workshop will also include working sessions in which participants will prepare draft submissions and receive feedback on their submissions. Each participant will be expected to leave the workshop with a draft poster submission that can be finalized and then submitted through the SC14 Poster Submissions application.</AbstractNarration>
