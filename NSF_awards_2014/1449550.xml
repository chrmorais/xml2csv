    <AbstractNarration>This award will continue and enhance the resource center (titled the Community for Advancing Discovery Research in Education, or CADRE) for the Discovery Research K-12 program. The project builds on the experience and expertise that evolved over six years in the development and implementation of CADRE. With this award, CADRE2 will maximize the individual and collective potential of DR K-12 awards by fostering collaboration and cross-sharing, and promoting the generation of new knowledge and products. CADRE2 will provide technical support to the awardees through communities of practice, a strong virtual presence, and an annual PI meeting; professional growth opportunities targeted particularly to early career researchers and developers; and aggressive outreach and dissemination to the DR K-12 community and beyond. CADRE2 will establish connections with other networks to leverage each other's strengths and services. The evaluation will focus on components that have promise for adaptation by future endeavors and by other networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will focus on support for early career researchers and developers, looking at interests and needs for professional growth. The network will also contribute to the knowledge base on capacity building, and provide a lens on dissemination of DR K-12 resources, materials, and tools within and external to the research and development community. The DR K-12 portfolio includes an estimated 300 projects that are driven by the field yet respond to parameters established by the National Science Foundation. Understanding the scope of the portfolio is important because collectively, the awards produce resources, models, and technologies that can influence the field. Convening the awardees in virtual and person-to-person venues, and promoting collaboration and interaction among the projects, maximizes the collective potential of the projects. With an emphasis on early career researchers and developers, CADRE2's impact extends into the building of the next generation of scholars. With an emphasis on communication and dissemination of the project findings and experiences, the knowledge related to STEM research will create a more evidence-based understanding of STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
