    <AbstractNarration>Moraine Valley Community College (MVCC) seeks to perform a feasibility study of replicating and refining the Brookdale Community College (BCC) CyberCenter Program (NSF funded as DUE-1331170). Both projects design, implement and evaluate an innovative pathway from cyber talent to cyber workforce. It includes a scalable, competition-driven, hands-on education model that has a potential to help with the nation's critical shortage of cybersecurity workforce. It will incorporate on-line courses, virtual labs and access tools to decrease overall per student cost in the CyberCenter program. The student cohort will include veterans and other underrepresented populations. The project will introduce significant modifications to the existing project that focus on maintaining student preparedness while reducing program cost. The students will be provided a 24-hour access to a virtual learning environment and will be required to complete a series of labs aligned with the NICE framework. If successful, the proposed competition-based model for developing the cybersecurity technical talent has a potential for dissemination and implementation in a large number of the 1,200 community colleges nationwide. Documenting that the available open courses are sufficient to obtain industry certifications will significantly decrease the overall cost of implementing or replicating this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comparative analysis will be performed between the project's participants and data collected on the first cohort of the BCC program. The team will specifically measure each participant's ability to pass industry certification exams, the scores they earn as well as their overall readiness for both industry residency programs and the permanent placement in the Cybersecurity workforce. The project team will redesign elements of the BCC program to utilize existing introductory level curriculum developed with funding from the NSF. Participants will then complete the advanced SANS courses. The original project is in the second year and this project is testing a variation of the approach to increase experiential learning and open course material for foundational courses. Both projects are considered a pilot of a possible large-scale implementation in multiple states and in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS Cyber Skills Task Force recommended creation of a community college program that would feed technical talent to mission critical cyber components of DHS. It is very likely that this pilot may be implemented widely to respond to DHS Task Force recommendations.</AbstractNarration>
