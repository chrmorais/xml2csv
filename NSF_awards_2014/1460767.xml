    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site is a joint effort by the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to promote diversity and retention in scientific fields related to solar and heliospheric physics. The synergy between these entities is facilitated by the colocation on the UAH campus of (i) the newly formed UAH Space Science department; (ii) the UAH Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research (CSPAR); and (iii) the NASA MSFC Solar Physics group. Each year 10 students will be selected and paired with scientists from either UAH or MSFC to work for 10 weeks over the summer on projects related to data analysis, instrumentation design and testing, simulations of plasma physics phenomena, or the development and implementation of theoretical and modeling techniques. Careful pairing of students skills with the requirements of the research projects, will allow acceptance of undergraduates across a wide range of experience levels, including those who have only completed their freshman year. A workshop is held during the first week of the program that includes lectures about the Sun and its interaction with the interstellar environment, and hands-on session that teach the basics of computer programming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project centers on the research performed by students, which they present as a poster at the end of the summer program. In addition, each participant is encouraged to submit their work to a scientific session at the annual American Geophysical Union conference held each December. The program has funds to partially support students attending this conference. The broader impacts of the project relate to the retention of students in STEM fields and the participation of minorities in science. To meet these goals recruitment efforts are targeted towards colleges and universities in the South-Eastern United States whose level of research activity is comparatively low or are minority serving institutions. Evaluation of applicants will include a ?need? factor in addition to more traditional assessments of academic preparation. This additional factor enables a keen student from a low research institution, who may have little or no understanding research experience, to compete acceptance into this REU with students from more research intensive schools. This program will aim to select a cohort of students each summer with a range of experience levels so that participants may learn research skills from peers in addition to their mentors.</AbstractNarration>
