    <AbstractNarration>Descriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge. Diversity in relevant characteristics across groups contributes to better deccisionmaking. Universities need to consider how best to retain excellent faculty and promote development across demographic groups. Attrition from the profession varies by demographic characteristics. One way to contribute to diversification within the profession is to evaluate the applicability of knowledge concerning what works in coalition building and what the outcomes might be. This workshop will bring together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers to build coalitions to deepen intellectual engagement, develop intellectual cross-fertilization and collaboration, and to build coalitions to support excellence in diversifying the profession throughout careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By applying the scholarship on diversity within organizations, effective coalition building, and outcomes in agendas, this workshop will contribute to developing diversity across the career course in the field.</AbstractNarration>
