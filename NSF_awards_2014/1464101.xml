    <AbstractNarration>Increasing the safety of high-capacity, high-discharge rate batteries is essential for all battery technologies. The safety problems stem from the breakdown of membranes separating the positive and negative poles of the battery. Such events lead to short-circuits leading to overheating and fires. Polymers for these membranes must be strong, temperature resilient, and have very small uniform pores. Successful preparation and use of these new materials could raise the specific energy of batteries to 200 Wh/kg, making possible a new generation of electrical vehicles with longer range, lower weight, higher speed, and better safety standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on new approaches to resolve this problem of safe membranes by evaluating the platform technology of aramid nanofibers membranes recently invented at University of Michigan. They are made from well-known Kevlar and show exceptional resilience to high temperature as well as high strength. Aramid nanofiber sheets can be potentially applicable for a wide spectrum of batteries. In the course of this project the team will establish the technological potential of the nanofiber-based membranes for automotive industry and consumer electronics producers. The team will also evaluate other potential uses of aramid nanofiber membranes for filtration and desalination.</AbstractNarration>
