    <AbstractNarration>Changing snowmelt patterns associated with climate variability pose challenges to water resources management in river basins around the world. Hydrologic models are useful to assess impacts of expected climate variability on snowmelt-driven watersheds, but are hampered by limited data. Even in well-instrumented basins data records on snow variables are too short to describe the long-term variability of snow cover, snow depth, and snowmelt. Tree rings, with a long history of application in hydrology, offer a solution to the data limitations. Tree-ring properties, such as ring-width, wood density, and the anatomical structure of cells, are sensitive to changes in hydrologic variables. Moreover trees that can provide such data are often widely distributed over forested watersheds, and the records they provide can extend from centuries to millennia. This project is the first effort at assembling and interpreting a network of tree-ring chronologies specifically for the purpose of studying snowmelt properties and snowpack. The research is being conducted along the American River, a vital source of water supply to the State of California. A goal of the research is to develop transferrable, generally useful, research tools for better understanding of snowmelt processes and their variability in space and time. The scientific understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrologic variables will benefit society through improvements in sustainable water resources planning and watershed management practices. The research will include field sampling and development of tree-ring chronologies and reconstructions of snowpack-related variables. Resulting data will enhance the infrastructure for research and education on hydroclimatic variability by expanding the available palaeoclimatic data networks. The project includes training of undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. In addition, it incorporates meetings with stakeholders to further the public understanding of science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changing snow-accumulation and snowmelt regimes in recent decades pose an increasing challenge to water resources management in the United States. Earlier melt and decreases in accumulation have been linked to both increasing winter and spring temperatures and an increasing fraction of precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. The existing observational networks in many basins do not have the spatiotemporal resolution to adequately characterize the variability of parameters relevant to these changes. Specifically, for the western USA, the intra-annual and spatial distribution of hydrological variables is poorly understood, as existing in-situ observations in the mountains are scarce and of short duration. The hypothesis of this interdisciplinary research is that key hydrological characteristics of the Sierra Nevada such as snow pack properties, precipitation, soil moisture and temperature can be constrained using the intra-annual features of tree rings. In addition, basin scale characteristics such as seasonal snow-line evolution and features of extreme events such as droughts can be identified. The novelty of this research is identification of key hydrological characteristics within a few days to weeks of occurrence. The research will explore the use of intra-ring properties of tree rings from multiple tree species and sites along an elevation transect in a snowmelt-driven watershed with goals of (a) improving the representation and scaling of land surface processes important to snowmelt processes in complex terrain, and (b) developing a method to detect the spatial variability and seasonality of evolving snowpack and soil moisture. The study basin is the North Fork of the American River, which drains the western side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California. Hydrometeorological variables will be derived for the sampling locations by merging a dense observational network and state-of-the-art land-surface model simulations. The cross association among hydrological variables and tree ring indicators will enable a description of the seasonal evolution of hydrological processes and provide for the development of proxy records that describe the spatial variability of various snow pack features.</AbstractNarration>
