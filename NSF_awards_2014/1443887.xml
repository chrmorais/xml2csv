    <AbstractNarration>Research on spectrum sharing has generated a large amount of spectrum measurement data and many spectrum sharing techniques. Most of the techniques are based on cognitive radio networks (CRNs) because the cognition capability is necessary for optimizing spectrum efficiency and guaranteeing safe coexistence in the presence of the spectrum uncertainty. Such cognitive capabilities collectively defines the intelligence of CRNs. Although cognition and intelligence are vital for CRNs, their quantitative specification is largely open. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses this open question by developing a framework for investigating quantitatively the cognitive capabilities and the intelligence of CRNs. This project develops both a theoretical approach and an empirical approach to construct a CRN intelligence model. This model is inspired from the Cattell-Horn-Carroll human intelligence model. On the other hand, the pioneering theoretical approach is in sharp contrast to conventional human intelligence research that is mainly empirical. In addition, this project develops a CRN testing battery to measure the intelligence as CRN IQ (intelligence quotient) following psychometric practices. Finally, this project initiates innovative research in IQ-based multi-hop routing and IQ-based immunity to Denial-of-Service attacks, where innovative CRN techniques are developed with the aim of enhancing important cognitive capabilities. This project adopts a big data approach to exploit the vast amount of existing spectrum measurement data and CRN research results. Psychometric techniques are exploited to resolve challenges involved in this big data application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project impacts society by expediting the commercial success of spectrum sharing technology. It integrates three traditionally disparate areas: wireless communications, psychology, and big data. The framework for constructing intelligence measure is useful to many other systems such as cognitive computing, cognitive control and cognitive radar. This project enhances the value of the spectrum measurement data and leads to a new direction for big data utilization. This project impacts education in many aspects, such as stimulating student research via the human intelligence analogy, supporting hands-on curriculum with the CRN testing battery, setting up CRN IQ competition projects, and outreaching to under-represented students and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project impacts society by expediting the commercial success of spectrum sharing technology.
