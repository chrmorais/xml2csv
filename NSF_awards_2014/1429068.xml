    <AbstractNarration>PI: Morgan, Elise F.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1429068&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI: Acquisition Of A Dual-Energy, 3-D X-Ray Microscope With Sub-Micron Resolution, Tunable Field Of View, and Phase Contrast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance&lt;br/&gt;3-D X-ray microscopy (XRM) has recently emerged as a non-destructive imaging modality with unprecedented versatility for study of numerous types of materials and structures. Newly developed XRM systems overcome key limitations of older systems, including the rigid trade-off between specimen size and image resolution (fixed field of view), inability to consolidate image data obtained from multiple beam energies, and reliance on absorption contrast as the only mode of imaging. As a result, XRM is now viable for a host of new and diverse applications in engineering and natural sciences. The XRM instrument for which funds are requested in this proposal is extremely well suited for fostering the integration of research and education. This instrument generates rich data sets via user-friendly software and hardware interfaces. These data, which include high-resolution 3-D renderings, cross-sectional views, and quantitative structural measures, are amenable to research projects and class assignments for students at multiple levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The research activities that will use this instrumentation address fundamental physical and biological phenomena in biomechanics, tissue engineering, skeletal and evolutionary biology, microfluidics, earth science, complex fluids, and high-temperature materials. Currently, these research activities use multiple methods, most of which are 2-D and/or destructive, to quantify microstructure and composition. The requested XRM instrument would add a new and profoundly enabling dimension to this existing armamentarium. This instrument generates rich data sets via user-friendly software and hardware interfaces. The data includes high-resolution 3-D renderings, cross-sectional views, and quantitative structural measures.</AbstractNarration>
