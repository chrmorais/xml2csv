    <AbstractNarration>The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program located at the BIOS marine research station in Bermuda. The program is held during the fall semester (12 weeks) and introduces eight undergraduate students per year to the techniques, skills and intellectual processes required to conduct research in oceanography and the marine sciences. Many REU research projects fall within the framework of the numerous long-term oceanographic programs at BIOS, but students also have opportunities to focus on near-shore processes including coral reef ecology, marine biodiversity, molecular biology, marine and atmospheric pollution and climate change. All REU students, regardless of project, have the opportunity to join BIOS scientists for a research cruise aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer. BIOS has an active education program that insures a diverse graduate student population, providing REU students with opportunities to interact with visiting students from Canada, the USA and the UK. Students also meet local scientists from the Bermuda Government and from industry. Students leave the program better prepared to pursue professional careers and/or graduate programs by virtue of conducting mentored research projects including the design, implementation, analysis, and final write-up.</AbstractNarration>
