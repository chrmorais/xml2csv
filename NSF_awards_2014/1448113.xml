    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable a new class of smaller, more efficient, and cheaper motors to be built. Since the motors use 43% - 46% of the world?s electricity, this has the potential to have one of the greatest impacts on overall electrical energy efficiency due to the shear amount of power this application uses. These unique windings will be sold to motor manufactures or be used in house to build motors and generators. By selling directly to existing motor manufacturers it will accelerate the penetration into the market. The market for windings is $2B and this approach has the potential for significant market share. This technology could impact wind generation, oil&amp;gas drilling, industrial manufacturing, aerospace, mining, transportation, and any market using motors more than 20hp in size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a process that can be used to make electric motors and generators smaller, more efficient, and cheaper. This project will specifically address the ability of electric insulation of the motor windings to have high voltage capability and high thermal conductivity. This combination will allow better motor cooling and in turn higher slot current densities. These higher current densities will allow motors to be smaller which will result in more efficient and lower cost motors. The research completed in this program will show exactly how the necessary bending can be accomplished with a complex mechanical simulation of the bend as well as experimental proof of concept of the electrical insulating capability of this unique winding. Additionally, a machine design for accomplishing this winding design will be designed to show a path to the low cost that will be necessary for widespread adoption in the industry. This combination should demonstrate a high voltage withstand at a high thermal conductivity all at a low production cost.</AbstractNarration>
