    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology&lt;br/&gt;Organization: Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities &lt;br/&gt;Title: HACU STEM Workforce (Conference Proposal) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1457940&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CREST Program is interested in building knowledge related to the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates in STEM disciplines of students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty from underrepresented groups, as well as the obstacles faced in promoting graduate study in STEM for students at minority-serving institutions and how these may effectively be overcome. With National Science Foundation support, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) will implement a Conference Project entitled: HACU STEM Workforce. The conference project will establish and convene an expert Task Force to develop policy recommendations and to identify and promote high impact practices to be implemented at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) as well as majority institutions for the development of a more diversified STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a national and international association of more than 450 colleges and universities committed to improving Hispanic success in higher education, HACU is positioned to convene such a Task Force, support its efforts, and promote both the policy recommendations and the high impact practices identified by the Task Force. While HACU member institutions in the U.S. represent only 10% of all higher education institutions nationwide, together these institutions enroll more than two-thirds of all Hispanic college students. HACU goals include promoting the development of member colleges and universities; improving access to and the quality of postsecondary educational opportunities for Hispanic students; and meeting the needs of business, industry and government through the development and sharing of resources, information and expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two reports will be produced as a result of the Task Force efforts, one discussing policy issues related to Hispanic STEM education and the other will highlight promising practices for creating a diverse STEM workforce. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities will publish the reports on its website, incorporate policy recommendations into its annual Legislative Agenda, and disseminate and promote high impact practices to its 450 member institutions, as well as majority institutions through its Annual Conferences and other program activities.</AbstractNarration>
