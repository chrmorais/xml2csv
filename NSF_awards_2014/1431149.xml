    <AbstractNarration>Improving the success and retention of community college students in STEM, especially underrepresented minority students, is crucial for increasing the number of STEM graduates nationwide. CUNY Kingsborough Community College, which serves a largely low income and highly diverse population of students, proposes to develop, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive set of proven approaches that target the major barriers of unpreparedness, lack of support networks, financial burdens, and inability to connect STEM education with daily life for students in their beginning biology courses. Improving student success in these early biology courses will lead to improvements in retention and increase the number of STEM students graduating and transferring to 4-year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three types of activities are proposed for students selected to participate in this program. First, a Strategies for Success in STEM workshop will be offered prior to General Biology I to strengthen basic reading, math, and study skills. Second, a community of biology learners will be established for students to collaboratively review biological principles, build camaraderie, and interact with faculty outside of the classroom setting. Third, a campus as a research lab approach that leverages the existing campus aquarium, farm, beach, and marine technology facilities will provide relevant research experiences and one-on-one faculty mentoring. Support will also be provided for faculty to develop and implement new pedagogies, receive training in assessment of classroom activities, and participate in opportunities to communicate their work both on campus and with the larger community. The goals are to improve student performance and retention; foster greater understandings of nature, science, and citizenship; and enhance the capacities of the faculty to engage students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these activities will be carefully evaluated through student interviews, concept inventories, assignments in community of biology learner meetings that explore misconceptions about biological concepts, and reflection papers about their campus as a research lab experiences. Evaluation of faculty activities will include interviews, surveys, focus groups, publications, presentations, and tracking of faculty involved in the project. Progress will be measured by the degree to which the project met its benchmarks. The mixed methods evaluation will provide valuable information, models, and materials that other community colleges can use as they struggle to improve STEM learning, retention, and transfer for low-income and underrepresented minority students.</AbstractNarration>
