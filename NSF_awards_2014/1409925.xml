    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the Division of Materials Research supports the development and proof of feasibility of a novel phase-sensitive superconducting dual-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to generate novel atomic-resolution images. Since their invention in 1981, scanning-tunneling microscopes (STMs) have revolutionized the understanding of the physics of materials by providing images and detailed electronic information of solids down to the atomic scale. An STM creates an image by measuring the current from electrons that tunnel between a sample surface and an extremely sharp tip that is scanned very closely above the sample surface. Tunneling is a quantum-mechanical process that allows electrons to flow through regions that they are forbidden from entering by the laws of classical physics. The novel type of STM being developped uses two superconducting tips connected by a superconducting wire; it operates a fraction of a degree above absolute zero temperature, and allows the imaging of coherent Cooper pair tunneling. This project, when completed, will be used to study superconductivity at the atomic scale in conventional superconductors as well as newer materials which display exotic forms of superconductivity. Measurements made with a dual-tip superconducting STM can be used to probe the underlying mechanisms causing superconductivity. The project involves undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the Division of Materials Research supports the development of a novel phase-sensitive superconducting dual-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the use of the instrument to generate novel atomic-resolution images and gain new insight into the mechanism producing superconductivity in high-transition temperature (Tc) superconductors and interesting phenomena in other materials. The system is based on a modification of an existing millikelvin STM in which two tips can be independently scanned, and can be either normal or superconducting, allowing for quasi-particle tunneling, or Cooper-pair tunneling in the quantum phase-fluctuation limit. By adding a superconducting wire connection between two superconducting tips, and using a superconducting sample, a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) loop is formed with the sample. With suitable biasing of the tips, this reduces fluctuations in the gauge-invariant phase difference across the nano-scale tips, allowing flux and phase sensitive imaging. In particular, this new capability will allow imaging of the spatial dependence of the gauge-invariant phase difference on the surface of superconducting samples at the atomic scale. The microscope will be tested at 35mK on well-understood superconducting materials such as Nb and Al and images generated of spatial variations in the local gauge-invariant phase difference near vortex cores, atomic defects, steps, and other surface irregularities. The project involves undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
