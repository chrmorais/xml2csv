    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program has identified STEM teacher preparation as one of its priorities and is committed to funding innovative models to support STEM teacher preparation and professional development. With support from the National Science Foundation, the professional development program at Hampton University will implement comprehensive strategies designed to transform STEM teaching and learning in an effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The one-year pilot study, designed to assist high school science teachers with developing inquiry-based learning activities, will impact a large population of minority students and provide opportunities for collaboration and career advancement for teachers. This project has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of minority students pursuing STEM degree programs and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to enhance the abilities of teachers to provide inquiry-based learning activities for their students by: 1) augmenting curriculum offerings to increase teachers' inventory of teaching activities, materials and tools; 2) increasing teachers' knowledge of STEM education; and 3) establishing collaborative networks with HU professors. It is expected that this project will enhance the teachers' content knowledge and expose them and their students to new concepts using materials related to their lives, history and culture. The inquiry-based activities manual, a product of this program, will be disseminated widely and thus benefit a large population.</AbstractNarration>
