    <AbstractNarration>How does variation among interacting groups of genes generate the remarkable diversity we observe among organisms? This research addresses several fundamental questions about the molecular mechanisms that produce unique characteristics among closely related species, and how these mechanisms have changed over time to produce variation in these traits. Dr. Masly and colleagues have developed several powerful resources in different fruit fly species that will allow them to identify the genes that underlie variation in the sizes and shapes of reproductive traits, and to understand how these genes function differently during the development of these traits to ultimately give rise to the distinctive characteristics of different species. The results of this work promise to inform our understanding of how genes control tissue growth and will provide insights into broader biological processes including the generation of biodiversity. These research activities also make several substantial contributions to education and community outreach. In particular, they provide transformative educational opportunities in science and technology for Native American students enrolled at two-year Tribal Colleges, and also for students enrolled at Dr. Masly's institution. The goal of these educational activities is to provide students with multidisciplinary training in genetics, development, evolution, and the use of cutting-edge imaging technologies. This will bolster undergraduate training in the molecular biosciences within the state of Oklahoma and provide its burgeoning biotechnology industry with a well-trained workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that generate biodiversity, and how these mechanisms evolve at the molecular level, are major goals of biology. A particularly striking example of biodiversity is the remarkable variation in the morphology of reproductive structures observed among closely related species of animals. It is thought that phenotypic change generally occurs by co-option or loss of entire gene regulatory networks (GRNs) or by variation of gene expression levels within GRNs. However, genetic mapping studies suggest that changes in GRN architecture itself may contribute to the extraordinarily rapid evolution of complex structures. The research objective is to dissect the genetic and developmental bases of species-specific reproductive morphology to understand how structural evolution occurs at the earliest stages of species divergence. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of a unique set of recombinant genetic lines and several novel transgenic reagents in 'non-model' Drosophila species. Dr. Masly's group will use these tools to identify and functionally characterize the genes that specify species variation in reproductive structure morphology and understand how variation among these loci directs developmental differences in real time. The educational objective is to use this research as a vehicle to engage undergraduate students in integrative biological research, with the ultimate goal of transforming the research experience and culture at Dr. Masly's institution and at Native American Tribal Colleges within Oklahoma. This will be accomplished by incorporating the research activities as the focus of a new inquiry-driven undergraduate course, and an intensive summer research program that provides Native students with access to STEM resources and training.</AbstractNarration>
