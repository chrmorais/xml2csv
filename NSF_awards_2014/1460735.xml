    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Oregon, in Eugene, OR, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. The REU provides closely mentored cutting edge research projects in a rich active learning environment for interns. Student interns receive research training in methodologies, presentation, critical thinking, and experimental design. The scientific focus of the REU Site is in molecular biosciences. Research areas include molecular biology, biochemistry, molecular neuroscience, molecular evolution, microbiology, developmental biology, genomics, structural biology &amp; biophysics, bioinformatics, molecular genetics, cell biology, and computational biology. Program features include training in responsible conduct of research, graduate school counseling, training in oral and written scientific communication, accessing, processing, and evaluating scientific literature, and informal and formal presentation of research outcomes. Weekly professional development workshops, research group discussions, faculty seminars, and oral and written progress reports provide rigorous preparation for graduate school and careers in research. Professional and social interactions with active researchers at all levels are offered. Targeting, recruiting and selection strategies focus on students having limited access to research opportunities, minority students from underrepresented groups, disadvantaged students, and those with disabilities. The selection process involves all participating faculty. Online application information is available at the program website listed below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and all interns are expected to attend and present findings at national professional conferences. The program aims to enhance the diversity and talent of the next generation of life scientists in the research community and train role models for further generations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to assess the effectiveness of the training program. All interns agree to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.
