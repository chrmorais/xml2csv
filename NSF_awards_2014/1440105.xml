    <AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of support and related administrative expenses for engaging U.S. radio scientists, including the U.S. National Committee (USNC), in the International Union of Radio Science (URSI). This includes affecting and guiding URSI scientific programs, helping to develop U.S. candidates for URSI leadership through involvement with commissions, and meeting the nation's responsibility to support URSI by paying dues. URSI is a non-governmental, non-profit scientific union devoted to scientific and technological developments across radio science disciplines. It has 46 member countries, and is one of the scientific unions that adhere to the International Council for Science. URSI covers numerous areas of interest within the radio science discipline, including radio astronomy, materials science, physics, remote sensing, geosciences, and space sciences. It stimulates and coordinates studies in the fields of radio, telecommunications, and electronic sciences, fostering international communications and collaborations through its ten commissions. The USNC organizes a yearly conference in the U.S., and oversees the U.S. participation in international URSI activities. URSI activities support the development and training of students and postdocs in numerous radio science activities, in both science and engineering, and help to develop the future leaders in the field. They promote better U.S. understanding of international perspectives, policy and culture, linking the U.S. radio science community and U.S. research to a wider international context. These activities are essential for effective U.S. international programs and policy-making.</AbstractNarration>
