    <AbstractNarration>Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe, and as such are important tracers of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Since galaxies are themselves made of dark matter, gas, dust, stars, and black holes, they also provide a unique probe of these fundamental quantities. Computers are now sufficiently powerful to resolve the internal structure of individual galaxies in simulations that model their formation from the initial conditions of the Big Bang. This CAREER award will push forward those simulations into the next generation in terms of resolution, as well as the modeling of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the physics of supermassive black holes. The simulations will allow astronomers to make some of the first direct observational predictions for the properties of galaxies being measured by major new observatories, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The work will also enable the PI and his team to revisit classic questions in galaxy formation, the regulation of star formation and black hole growth, and cold dark matter cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this research project are to produce and analyze a suite of cosmological simulations that explicitly resolve the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) of for the first time. The unique combination of realistic feedback from stars and supermassive black holes, dramatically improved numerical algorithms, and state-of-the art resolution will enable the PI to dramatically improve the predictive power of galaxy formation models. In addition, the team will make public and support the new numerical methods developed as part of this work, which will help to resolve many numerical problems and barriers that have compromised the accuracy and interpretation of previous-generation simulations. This will allow the community to assess the relative importance of numerics and physics in galaxy formation in a way that has not been possible in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to leverage the visual excitement of simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies by partnering with the Shafran Planetarium and Mueller Observatory at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, as well as data visualization experts. Together they will build and distribute a new platform to allow scientists to integrate their galaxy simulations into planetarium astronomy shows and television programs. The work is expected to dramatically increase the number and quality of astronomy visualizations entering the public domain, which will improve astronomical education tools across the country.</AbstractNarration>
