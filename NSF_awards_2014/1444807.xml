    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the University of Southern California for the support of the NSE Education Workshop to be held in Arlington, Virginia on December 11-12, 2014. The workshop will be under the direction of Dr. James Murday and co-funded by the NSF Directorate for Engineering and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will address the challenges/opportunities facing nanoscale science/engineering education (NSEE) worldwide, with special attention to: a) an assessment of the global NSEE efforts to see what has been working best; b) the goal of scaling up availability/usage of the best NSEE resources, c) the symbiosis among NSE, information technology, biology/medicine, and cognitive processes (U.S. BRAIN1 and European Union Brain Project initiatives2); d) the NSEE Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) opportunities engendered by the newly released U.S. Next Generation K-12 Science Standards3; e) changing needs in the workforce as nanotechnology continues its rapid market penetration; f) the need and possible mechanisms for ongoing public education and engagement with nanoscale science, engineering, and technology; and g) roles for NSEE in broadening participation in the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will address the NSE needs for all the stages of education. This integrated approach is necessary since the stages of education are all interrelated.</AbstractNarration>
