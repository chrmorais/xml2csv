    <AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the Wind Energy Science, Engineering and Policy (WESEP) REU Site at Iowa State University is to engage undergraduate students in high quality research experiences through an intellectually stimulating 10-week summer research program that focuses on WESEP research issues. Recognizing the vital importance of renewable energy to the long term sustainability of the US energy portfolio and the substantial role that wind energy plays in new power generation capacity, this program provides a unique research experience for undergraduate students to play a role in shaping the US energy future. Research projects are designed to motivate and prepare students for graduate research in science and engineering. Participants will leave with a greater understanding and appreciation of the importance that wind energy plays in meeting national renewable goals and the rewarding research career opportunities available. The program builds on existing relationships with HBCUs and universities in Puerto Rico as well as Iowa State University programs for broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012, for the first time, wind energy accounted for the largest portion of new generating capacity in the US, exceeding new natural gas generation capacity. However, when compared with other nations that are increasing their wind energy portion of energy production, the US ranked 12th with less than 6% of total electric generating capacity. The project addresses a critical, long-term national need to increase the availability of cost-effective renewable energy that will help reduce our carbon footprint, water usage, and meet future energy demands. The WESEP research program includes five research areas: (1) Wind energy resource characterization and aerodynamic loads; (2) Wind energy conversion systems and grid operations; (3) Manufacturing, construction, and supply chain; (4) Reliability and turbine health monitoring; and (5) Politics and policy for wind energy. Individual projects will typically be tied to one or more ongoing ISU research team projects which are funded by a variety of agencies including NSF, DOE, Iowa Department of Economic Development, ISU, and industry partners. Because of its location, strength in wind energy related disciplines, and ongoing partnerships with industry, Iowa State University provides an intellectually challenging environment for interdisciplinary educational programs in WESEP. Participants in the WESEP REU program will learn: (1) how to conduct research as part of a collaborative research team; (2) how to present and publish their findings; (3) the role of ethics in research; (4) the technical and policy challenges in wind energy; and (5) that research can be a rewarding career path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acknowledgement: This project is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
