    <AbstractNarration>This travel grant supports participation, particularly of young mathematicians, in the special conference Connections in Discrete Mathematics, held June 15-19, 2015 at the Burnaby Campus of Simon Fraser University (located in British Columbia, Canada). This conference will bring together many leaders in several areas of discrete mathematics to share their research, and also will present an opportunity for young researchers to interact with senior personnel and form new research collaborations. As a result, the meeting will have a positive influence on the careers of young researchers in discrete mathematics. More about the conference and its organization is at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/site/connectionsindiscretemath/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference topic of discrete mathematics includes many fields of mathematics, including number theory, graph theory, Ramsey theory, combinatorics, algorithmic analysis, discrete geometry, and more. While each of these fields is important in its own right, they also share important ideas and techniques that unite them. This conference brings together a diverse group of researchers in discrete mathematics to share their work, and to look for connections (both in terms of the research and in collaborations).</AbstractNarration>
