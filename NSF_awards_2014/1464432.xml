    <AbstractNarration>Human-in-the-loop control strategies in which the user performs a task better, and feels more confident to do so, is an important area of research for cyber-physical systems. Humans are very adept at learning to control complex systems, particularly those with non-intuitive kinematic constraints (e.g., cars, bicycles, wheelchairs, steerable needles). With the advent of cyber-physical systems, (physical systems integrated with cyber control layer), human control is no longer constrained to system inputs. Users can also control system outputs through a number of different teleoperation mappings. Given all this flexibility, what is the most intuitive way for a human user to control an arbitrary system and how is intuitiveness quantified?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on human-in-the-loop control for medical needles, which steer with bicycle-like kinematics. These needles could be used in a variety of medical interventions including tissue biopsy, tumor ablation, abscess drainage, and local drug delivery. We have explored a variety of teleoperation mappings for human control of these steerable needles; yet, we have found inconsistencies between objective performance metrics (e.g., task time and error), and post-experimental surveys on comfort or ease-of use. Users occasionally report a preference for control mappings, which objectively degrade performance, and vice versa. It is important to measure the real-time engagement of the user with the physical system in order to capture the nuances of how different control mappings affect physical effort, mental workload, distraction, drowsiness, and emotional response. Physiological sensors such as electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and electromyography (EMG), can be used to provide these real-time measurements and to quantitatively classify the intuitiveness of new teleoperation algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Intuitive and natural human-in-the-loop control interfaces will improve human health and well being, through applications in surgery and rehabilitation. The results of this study will be disseminated publicly on the investigator's laboratory website, a conference workshop, and a new medical robotics seminar to be held jointly between UT Dallas and UT Southwestern Medical Center. Outreach activities, lab tours, and mentoring of underrepresented students at all levels, will broaden participation in STEM. Additionally, the proximity of the investigator?s hospital-based lab to medical professionals will engage non-engineers in design and innovation</AbstractNarration>
