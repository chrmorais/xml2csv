    <AbstractNarration>Galaxy surveys in the local universe such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have shown that galaxies populate two broad categories: blue, star-forming disk galaxies and red, quiescent spheroidal or early-type galaxies. In the nearby universe, the most luminous and massive galaxies are quiescent, and they are preferentially found in dense environments, such as groups and clusters. In contrast, star-forming galaxies have lower stellar masses and occupy low-density environments. Astronomers also know that star-formation in the universe was significantly more active several billion years ago. The key question that will be answered by this research is the following: what physical processes drive the suppression of star formation and nuclear activity between early times and the present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable for the next phase of the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey of galaxies. This includes a comprehensive, near-IR spectroscopic survey with the Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck 10-m telescope, together with multi-wavelength (X-ray, radio, and infrared) observations. By correlating with the precise measures of local and global environment afforded by ORELSE, the program will determine the cause and effect of gas-fueling and quenching events that drive galaxy evolution over a critical 3-billion year period where star formation and nuclear activity are rapidly declining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will also expand the underrepresented student base by supporting the Mentorship for Undergraduate Research Participants in Physical and Mathematical Sciences (MURPPS) program at the University of California-Davis. The program will increase the number of underrepresented students who can participate in MURPPS by over 30% and is directly aligned with the NSF's commitment to achieve full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
