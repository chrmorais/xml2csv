    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will award scholarships to academically talented Biology, Chemistry, and Physics majors interested in careers and graduate education, who also demonstrate financial need. The scholarship recipients will form a cohort of students who undertake pursuit of a Computational Science minor that will expose them to computational techniques relevant to their major field of study. New and existing support structures will be used to ensure the success of each scholar. Key academic features of this project will include opportunities for participation in undergraduate research, conference presentations and/or publications on this research, and a senior capstone interdisciplinary project in computational science. Talented STEM graduates with a background in computational sciences will help U.S. industries by contributing to a workforce able to compete and innovate in a global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research has shown that a computational science curriculum can benefit STEM students in a variety of ways including (a) expanding employment options for those who enter college loving science without knowing how they will use the degree when they graduate, (b) providing them with a compelling context in which to learn mathematical and computing concepts thereby, aiding retention, and (c) requiring them to work in interdisciplinary teams and subsequently learn how to communicate science more effectively. Formative and summative evaluation will consist of comparisons of S-STEM participant retention rates and satisfaction with students in the STEM Honors Program and the general STEM population at PLNU. Dissemination of the results of evaluation and information about the project in general, will be done through a website and national meetings sponsored by the Special Interest Group for Computer Science Education or the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The work will also be presented at Joint Mathematics Meetings (attended by special interest groups on mathematics in industry and mathematical biology). The results will be submitted to disciplinary educational journals such as PRIMUS: Problems, Resources, and Issues in Mathematics Undergraduate Studies, The Journal of Chemical Education, and Physical Review Special Topics - Physics Education Research.</AbstractNarration>
