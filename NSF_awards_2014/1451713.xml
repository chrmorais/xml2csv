    <AbstractNarration>While there is much discussion on what needs to be changed in engineering education and how those changes should take place, there is no current venue for sustaining a meaningful dialog on change and archiving these discussions for the benefit of the entire engineering community. The proposed workshops will help to advance knowledge and understanding about the purposes of engineering education and begin a well-informed and lasting dialog on possible ways to reconceptualize engineering education for the benefit of all participants. Sustained and informed dialog is needed to created change in the face of the major disruptions taking place in higher education and the workplace. To sustain the needed on-going dialog, these workshops are framed around the organizational structure of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE). A major goal of this effort is to ensure broad and diverse participation. The leaders of three ASEE divisions will coordinate the workshop. The workshops and significant dissemination effort will broadly impact society by creating a scholarly and sustainable dialog between multiple stakeholders in engineering education. The workshops are intended to open up a new venue for dialog that captures a broader range of voices. The project plan includes participation of the needed diverse elements of the larger engineering education system. The plan provides resources for long-term, sustainable dissemination anticipated to be in the form of a self-sustaining dialog and discussion journal.</AbstractNarration>
