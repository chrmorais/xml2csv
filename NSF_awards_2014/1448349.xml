    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide motors / generators that will be more practical to buy, use, and maintain, because Circular Flux Devices (CFDs) are a fundamental advancement in efficiency and practicality of both motors and generators. Because CFDs are more efficient, they will consume less energy per motor unit. Since about half the electricity on earth is consumed by electrical motors and all electricity is produced from electrical generators, even small improvements in these devices will result in significant energy reduction. Higher efficiency along with lower weight, cost, and size were specifically requested in the Department of Energy?s, Electric Vehicles Everywhere Challenge. CFMs answer those needs and the needs of many other evolving and current motor applications. Also, the much lighter Circular Flux Generators (CFG) solves the weight issue of direct drive wind-turbines enabling the elimination of the costly and high maintenance gearboxes. CFG wind-turbines will be lower-cost to build, install, and maintain, making wind power more cost-effective. Greenhouse gases diminish as wind-power replaces fossil fuel plants. The anticipated results are a scientific understanding and commercialization of a new technology that will significantly improve our society by reducing global energy consumption and global warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the understanding and development of the fundamentally new concept of a Circular Flux Device (CFD) to a level that will enable, promote, and facilitate their commercialization. Generators and motors are designed today basically the same as described by Nikola Tesla in the late 1800s. This old design makes them heavier, larger, and more expensive than necessary, limiting their applications and efficiency. However, CFDs enabled by the patented Folded Electromagnetic Coil are a fundamental improvement that makes these devices lighter, smaller, less-expensive, and more-efficient. The design is substantially different and represents a fourth topology concept, Circular Flux. Since the CFD is fundamentally new and commercial application is currently available, considerable research and development is needed to fully understand how they work and how to optimize and commercialize them. Thus, the research objectives are focused on analysis, building prototypes, and testing prototypes, that should result in a better understanding of this new technology.</AbstractNarration>
