    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: CBET 1463727&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Cincinnati&lt;br/&gt;Title: Student Travel Grant- 2015 National Combustion Meeting, Cincinnati, OH, May 17 - 20, 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is jointly hosted by the University of Cincinnati, the Central States Section&lt;br/&gt;of the Combustion Institute, and General Electric Aviation. The requested NSF funding&lt;br/&gt;is to partially offset the cost of participation by students and post-doctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Meeting draws researcher from academia, industry, and government and private research organizations, focusing on all aspects of combustion and fire phenomena including kinetics, flames, and reacting flows investigated using various tools - theoretical, computational, and experimental. Student participants will be exposed to the current status of the combustion research will be on display. The students supported by this grant are required to present their accepted papers and, as a result, will subsequently engage in many discussions with their audience in particular and the community in general. The meeting palys an important part in a young researcher's process of becoming a mature researcher, which in time will serve them well in their career development and in their ability in mentoring future researchers. The meeting will feature a "Women in Combustion" event which encourages networking between women in the field and provides opportunities for female graduate students to meet role models and mentors in faculty, government and industrial positions. It will also hold job fairs for students and post-doctoral researchers, which the travel grant receiving students and post-docs are required to attend.</AbstractNarration>
