    <AbstractNarration>EAGER: Single-step processing of self-assembled magneto-dielectric hybrid composites for microwave phased array sensors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Colorado at Colorado Springs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing demand for smaller, lighter and smarter electronic devices has detonated the development of new active and passive components for microwave signal processing, with compact designs and low power requirements. However, traditional materials are not the best option for the new generation of microwave devices, since miniaturization brings several critical challenges. Additionally, fabrication methods become more complex and expensive as the device size gets smaller. Within this exploratory research, scientists propose a very interesting approach: to take advantage of the interactions of the electromagnetic radiation with ordered functional nanostructures, designed and tailored for the specific frequency range of the intended application. Even more, they intend to shift a paradigm toward producing new microwave materials and devices in a single step by directly printing the device structure either on a rigid or flexible substrate. This revolutionary idea engages novel cross-disciplinary perspectives in terms of microwave fundaments and electromagnetic interactions with soft matter to radically transform the materials, prototyping, and manufacture of microwave components. Scientists expect that this novel platform will provide a completely new perspective for the well-established electronic industry to overcome the rapidly approaching limits and costs of both, the current materials and technologies. The results of the project will be shared with industrial partners locally and nationally to spur further innovation and job creation, and will be broadly disseminated through technical presentations and publications to contribute to the advancement of the frontiers of knowledge. Additionally, the project will bring new research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, scientists offer a transformative approach to integrate self-assembled block copolymers as building blocks for complex microwave devices based on magneto-dielectric hybrid nanostructures and process by inkjet printing, opening a completely new path for highly integrated, power efficient and cost-effective devices. The exploratory research will focus on: (i) optimization of the phase separation in printed block copolymers; (ii) printing functional ordered magneto-dielectric nanostructures with optimized connectivity for microwave devices, specifically phased array sensors; and (iii) device optimization and prototyping, all in a single step, under a simple and low cost regime. They take advantage of the uniqueness of block copolymers to undergo phase separation into nanodomains, functionality of inorganic nanoparticles, tailoring properties of photonic band gap materials, simplicity of inkjet printing, and the versatility of flexible substrates. Their work will lead to the creation of a new paradigm - bottom-up building of periodic photonic band gap materials based on magneto-dielectric hybrid composites of self-assembled block copolymers filled with nanoparticles, printed as a complete device in a single-step printing process. Thus, the project will result in new, innovative, smaller, lighter and cheaper microwave components. The developed platform will have utility not only in the specific target of phased array sensors but in a variety of microwave reciprocal and nonreciprocal devices, including phase shifters, circulators, stop/pass band filters, and antennas.</AbstractNarration>
