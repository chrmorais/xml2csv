    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program is supporting fundamental research by Professor Alexander Greer at the City University of New York, Brooklyn College. Professor Greer will develop techniques for accurately studying the chemistry of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS such as singlet oxygen and alkoxy radicals are of broad importance in mechanistic and synthetic chemistry and critical to understanding oxidative processes in biology. This research seeks to create modified polymer surfaces which will provide a matrix for spatially controlled generation and delivery of ROS. Newly synthesized polymers will be used to study controlled photooxidation chemistry in organic solutions, but also may have broader scientific impact in bacterial inactivation systems. The project will support training of research students to ground them in the necessary photoscientific methods. Professor Greer and his students will engage in outreach to local high schools and colleges, emphasizing the value of improving solar energy resources and water purification research. These talks will be presented in the context of the United Nations IYL2015 (International Year of Light and Light-Based Technologies). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, new heterogeneous methods will be developed for the physical isolation of sensitizer and peroxide molecules to generate singlet oxygen and alkoxy radicals at polymer surfaces. The research will provide a method for conducting controlled oxidation chemistry that will facilitate a range of future studies on selective oxidation, chemical aging, flow and disinfection chemistry. One key feature of this heterogeneous chemistry will be the ability to break surface-bound peroxide bonds to regulate the alkoxy radicals formed. The research will be relevant to organic chemistry, and has potentially broader implications related to the oxidative degradation of materials.</AbstractNarration>
