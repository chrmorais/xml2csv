    <AbstractNarration>This project is supported under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program, which is an NSF-wide program although each Directorate administers its own REU Site competition. This program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in an effort to introduce them to scientific research so as to encourage their continued engagement in the nation's scientific research and development enterprise. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. The REU program is a major contributor to the NSF's goal of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences Directorate awarded this REU Site grant to Western Kentucky University Research Foundation which aims to provide undergraduate students with hands-on research experience examining technology as a means of advancing our understanding of human behavior and cognition. This project is likely to advance knowledge of the field of psychology by training future scholars in advanced research methods and utilizing cutting-edge technology to conduct high-quality psychological research. This project has the potential to impact society by a) advancing the field of psychology by conducting cutting-edge research that will be translated into national and/or international presentations and publications, b) providing valuable research training to the next generation of psychological scientists, and c) recruiting students from underrepresented STEM groups in order to increase their familiarity with scientific research methods in the field of psychology and spark their interest in STEM-related careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the REU project is to provide a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in psychological research to undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities where there are limited research opportunities. Utilizing a targeted recruitment method, at least 50% of program participants will be qualified, first-generation college students, racial minorities, or students with disabilities, with an emphasis on those from rural or disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds in the Appalachia region. Students spend 10 weeks working closely with a faculty mentor on research utilizing technological advances in the various subspecialties of psychology. Students participate in developmental workshops and activities related to topics such as ethics, research methods, statistics, computer software, and presentation skills. At the conclusion of the program, students present their findings at a mini research conference in front of university faculty and staff. To broaden the project's impact, all students are expected to disseminate their research findings at a national or international conference and students are strongly encouraged to submit their research findings for publication. The goal is to have participants develop strong skills as psychological researchers, thereby increasing the likelihood that a majority of program participants will pursue graduate degrees and/or careers in the psychological sciences or closely related fields.</AbstractNarration>
