    <AbstractNarration>The conference Hyperbolic Geometry and Minimal Surfaces will be held at the Instituto Nacional de Matem√°tica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, January 4-10, 2015 and will consist of a five-day lecture series given by experts in the fields of hyperbolic geometry and minimal surfaces. The goal of the conference is to educate participants in current research topics and to provide a forum for collaboration on problems at the intersection of the two fields. Through this interaction, the conference seeks to produce new directions of research in geometry related to hyperbolic geometry and minimal surfaces, and provide research development for junior researchers and graduate students through interaction with leading experts in the fields. The conference will also provide a venue for mathematicians from North, Central and South America to gather to collaborate and share ideas. By helping develop and broaden the research program of attendees, both junior and senior, this will further strengthen and broaden the development of mathematics education in their home institutions and countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the workshop is to investigate problems at the intersection of hyperbolic geometry and minimal surfaces. Hyperbolic geometry has seen great advances inrecent years on major problems in the field. In particular for hyperbolic three-manifolds, the geometrization conjecture, ending lamination conjecture, tameness, virtual Haken conjecture, and virtual fibering conjecture, have all been proved. Incompressible surfaces and minimal surfaces played an important role in this work. By focusing the conference on hyperbolic geometry an minimal surfaces, the expectation is to continue the development of this interaction between the two areas. Topics will include, Minimal surfaces in hyperbolic manifolds, Min-max techniques in hyperbolic geometry, and Systoles in expanding families of hyperbolic manifolds.
