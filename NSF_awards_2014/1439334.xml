    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of the US Ignite is to break a fundamental deadlock: there is insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage of advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and dispersed. And conversely, there is a lack of broad availability of advanced broadband infrastructure for open experimentation and innovation because there are few advanced applications and services to justify it. US Ignite applications are focused on national priority areas of advanced manufacturing, clean energy and transportation, cyber learning, health IT, and public safety/emergency preparedness. Many of the applications under development in this program build on NSF-funded advanced networking and computational infrastructure developed as part of the NSF GENI program. All of the projects demonstrate the value of advanced networking. This project supports the 2nd annual US Ignite Application Summit, an event which will demonstrate the next generation applications currently being developed, educate a broad community on the potential for next-generation application capabilities and recruit cities and individuals for the next round of application development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Applications Summit is being held June 24-27, 2014, in Sunnyvale, CA. This project supports academic and student participation in the Summit, and helps offset the costs of hosting the event and disseminating results.</AbstractNarration>
