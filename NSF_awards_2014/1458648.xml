    <AbstractNarration>The Middle Tennessee Mechatronics Scholars Program at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) plans to increase the number of students in the school's new Mechatronics Engineering baccalaureate degree program by 50% and retain at least 80% of incoming freshmen to the sophomore year. At least 15 new freshman majors will receive scholarships each year, allowing students to focus on their studies, complete college in four years instead of six, and give them two additional years of earnings and less debt. S-STEM scholarships will enable the program to recruit talented, dedicated students who will succeed in the rigorous engineering curriculum. The Tennessee automotive industry needs strong mechatronics engineers and this project will help meet this significant workforce need in Tennessee. The need for mechatronics engineering education is growing, not only in the middle Tennessee area, but also across the entire country as many mechatronics positions are seeking qualified applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities for members of the cohort to participate in educational activities during their first year include a week long summer training experience at Siemens Headquarters in Berlin, Germany, a four week mechatronics research team project, intrusive advising, tutoring, mentoring, and manufacturing plant tours. Later, internships and significant interactions in the automotive manufacturing industry are possible. A dedicated professional advisor and predictive analytics software will enable project leaders to detect and address issues that place students at-risk. MTSU faculty and students will contribute to the engineering education literature related to early research experiences for engineering students, the impact of various support activities on the success of freshman engineering students, and the impact of hands-on project work on retention of female and minority engineering students. Comparing a) the building of a high quality engineering program using the Siemens systems approach and high level of student-industry interaction to b) a traditional engineering education will be a helpful contribution to the engineering education literature.</AbstractNarration>
