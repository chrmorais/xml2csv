    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics at Florida State University in conjunction with The Department of Mathematics at The University of Arkansas is organizing the conference "Clifford Analysis and Related Topics" to take place at Florida State University during December 15, 16 and 17, 2014. A conference has been established: http://www.math.fsu.edu/cart2014/. The motivation for this conference is to bring together top researchers in this field along with students and early career mathematicians to discuss and collaborate on recent and continuing research. Such interactions are especially valuable to students. Clifford Analysis has ties to many other branches of mathematics as well as important applications in physics and in particular to signal processing. This award supports travel for participants in the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clifford analysis is based Clifford algebras in the same way that complex analysis is based on the complex numbers. Indeed the complex numbers are a simple Clifford algebra. However higher dimensional Clifford algebras are noncommutative and contain zero divisors. The topics of this conference include compactification of Clifford algebras and their Mobius geometry, representation theory of conformal and orthogonal groups, Clifford analysis on Heisenberg groups, and subelliptic Dirac operators on CR manifolds.</AbstractNarration>
