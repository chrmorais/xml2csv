    <AbstractNarration>Computational systems biology is a multi-disciplinary research area that combines biology, computer science, engineering and statistics. The goal of this research area is to develop and apply computational methods for analyzing of complex biological phenomena. The 2014 IEEE Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics (GENSIPS) aims to bring together expertise in biology, computer science, signal processing, engineering and statistics, and provide a forum to discuss challenges confronting the research community. GENSIPS'14 teamed up with the 2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP'14), a flagship conference in IEEE Signal Processing Society that brings together 13 symposia and 2 workshops. GENSIPS is one of the two workshops, and is synergistic to symposiums on algorithms, big data and machine learning. Such a partnership is anticipated to foster collaborations and interdisciplinary research ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The theme of GENSIPS-14 is going to be centered around computational systems biology and signal processing. One major goal is to provide a forum for addressing research problems at the forefront of this area, including next-generation sequencing, integration of multi-modality genomics data, modeling of regulatory and signaling networks, single-cell analysis, metagenomics, and several other topics in this fast growing field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The partnership with GlobalSIP-14 attracts participations from the signal processing society. To enable signal processing researcher to jump-start in computational systems biology, GENSIPS-14 offers three tutorials on drug effect prediction, single-cell analysis, and imaging informatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another important mission of GENSIPS-14 is to promote the participation of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers (especially women and minority), and foster education and development of the next-generation scientists in computational systems biology. GENSIPS-14 will provide travel awards to encourage graduate students to participate. Specifically, 20-30% of the awards will be allocated to encourage women and minority students to participate and submit papers to GENSIPS-14.</AbstractNarration>
