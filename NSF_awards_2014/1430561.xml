    <AbstractNarration>The International Union of Radio Science (URSI) General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (GASS) is held every three years. In 2011 the 30th URSI General Assembly was held in Istanbul, Turkey, with over 1,200 attendants. The next URSI-GASS will be held in Beijing, China on August 14-23, 2014. The National Academy of Sciences provides travel fellowships for young scientists to attend the URSI-GASS and travel support for senior scientists to represent the United States at the URSI Council meetings. Ultimately this ensures that we are maintaining U.S. pre-eminence in the field of radio science, strengthening the current and future health of U.S. scientific research and promoting scientific advances in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is conducted by the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Radio Science (USNC-URSI) which operates under the Board on International Scientific Organizations in the Policy and Global Affairs Division. The support for senior scientists to represent the United States at the URSI Council meetings allows them to participate in union discussions on scientific, programmatic, financial, and organizational topics; work with colleagues from other countries on resolutions and other union matters; and work with the U.S. early career travel awardees to ensure they are fully included and involved in the Scientific Symposium. The travel fellowships encourage students at U.S. universities to participate in the Scientific Symposium and in the 2014 URSI General Assembly and allow younger researchers to participate in scientific meetings in their field and to present their research to colleagues in an international setting. This exposes them to new scientific developments from both leading U.S. and international institutions, and contributed to their education and their professional development.</AbstractNarration>
