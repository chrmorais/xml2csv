    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven Stevenson of the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) will study the preparation of metallic nitride clusters entrapped within larger, higher fullerene cages (HMNFs). These unique molecules have significant potential applications in energy (e.g., photovoltaics), medicine (e.g., pharmaceuticals, MRI contrast agents), and optoelectronics. However, they are difficult to obtain in large quantity. Professor Stevenson aims to improve the preparation of these molecules by improving the reaction yield and by simplifying the product isolation procedure. His product isolation procedure will also reduce significantly the amount of waste solvents generated. The project promotes the inclusion of underrepresented groups of students, high school students and early undergraduate (e.g., freshman, sophomore) students in research. Efforts will also be made to attract non-chemistry major students, as they have few opportunities for chemical research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three specific objectives. In the 1st objective, new molecules will be selectively created inside a plasma reactor. The interior of the reactor will possess a chemically harsh environment by incorporating oxidizing agents into the plasma zone, in order to suppress the formation of contaminant species. The 2nd objective is the integrated SAFA (the Stir and Filter Approach)-Lewis acid approach for the efficient non-chromatographic purification of HMNFs. In the 3rd objective, collaborative activities with four Ph.D.-granting institutions will serve to evaluate the properties of HMNFs prepared.</AbstractNarration>
