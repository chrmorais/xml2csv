    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Samford University, located in Birmingham, AL, will provide research training for 12 students, for 9 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. The program focuses on multidisciplinary research to study biological and biochemical interactions ranging from the molecular to the landscape scale in a diverse Appalachian ridge and valley ecosystem at Oak Mountain State Park (OMSP) near Birmingham, AL. There are a wide range of potential student projects, involving both field and laboratory research, to address questions in ecology, population biology, botany, geography, plant chemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, cell biology and pathogenesis. Mentors are from the Departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry, Geography, and Pharmacy at Samford University and Birmingham Southern College. Students are selected based on academic record, professional goals, and potential for outstanding research. Outstanding undergraduate students who have limited opportunities to participate in research at their home institutions and students from underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 36 students will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. In addition to research, students will participate in weekly workshops on ethical conduct in research, data analysis, professional communication skills, professional development activities, and the graduate school application process. Discussions and seminars with mentors, experts, and fellow students will help participants integrate their knowledge about complex biological and biochemical interactions across research topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of their research experience.
