    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this NUE project, Engineering Innovation in Biomedical Nanotechnology, at the University of Arizona (UA), under the direction of Dr. Eniko T. Enikov, is to develop to introduce nanoscale science and engineering through an innovative use of a technical elective senior design course in mechatronics, followed by an ABET-mandated senior-level engineeirng capstone design project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities include: 1) Delivery of mechatronics design course focused on use of giant magneto-resistance (GMR) sensors and the fabrication of an electro-spinning manufacturing cell. 2) Mentoring of two senior capstone design teams/year comprised of engineering and business students who will use the GMR sensors and electro-spinning apparatus in clinical applications (In collaboration with the UA College of Medicine and the College of Management). 3) Demonstration of a working prototype of a smart catheter with embedded flow sensor enabled by the application of super-paramagnetic nano-particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to develop a model for nanotechnology education that can be adopted by other institutions. To broaden the impact of the project, the PIs have partnered with the UA McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Eller College of Management whereby student teams of engineering and business students will develop product ideas based on nanotechnology and subsequently create product prototypes as part of the senior capstone design course in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on the prior work of the PI, Dr. Enikov, in developing undergraduate laboratory experiments in nanotechnology, which showed that an evolutionary design approach can be used successfully to complete a relatively complicated nanotechnology project within the framework of the standard junior- and senior-year courses.</AbstractNarration>
