    <AbstractNarration>1445840&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Conferences International, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;Freeman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to partially support approximately 10 graduate students and young faculty to participate in the Engineering Conferences International Meeting on Advanced Membrane Technology VI in February 2015 in Sicily, Italy. The meeting is scheduled to have 14 technical sessions covering recent advances in membrane research, development and applications. Some examples include wastewater reclamation, gas and liquid separations and purifications, and energy issues. A poster session is also an integral part of the meeting. The meeting will feature a number of internationally renowned and up and coming researchers. Approximately 130 membrane researchers from all parts of the world are expected to attend, representing industry, government and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separation technology constitutes 50 to 75% of the capital investment in a chemical plant, according to a report of the National Research Council. Membrane technology is an important part of the separation technology. Its usage in the chemical industry is growing due to its versatility and low-energy consumption as compared with other separation processes, such as distillation. Because of the industrial needs for efficient separation technology and the advances in material science, many new membrane materials, processes, and applications are being commercialized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funding will be used for participant support at this meeting to help offset (including room and board) costs for student and young faculty participants.</AbstractNarration>
