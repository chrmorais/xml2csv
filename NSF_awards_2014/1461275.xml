    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL PART: Each summer the REU Site will invite nine undergraduate students and one secondary school teacher to Colorado School of Mines (CSM) to perform cutting-edge research in renewable energy. These highly interdisciplinary studies are open to all undergraduate students majoring in engineering, materials science, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science. The secondary school teacher will be active in math, science, or preparatory engineering classes. Students will participate in a 10-week effort, while the teacher will be immersed in a synchronous 5-week program that blends a research experience with a curriculum development expectation. All participants will work directly with CSM faculty mentors and scientific staff from the nearby National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the on-campus Renewable Energy Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (REMRSEC). As the nation's primary laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development, NREL partners with REMRSEC to continuously develop undergraduate students' skills, knowledge, and interests in renewable energy with the purpose of creating a pipeline that supports its future research strands and employment needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART: The project will provide CSM graduate students the opportunity to assist faculty mentors in the design and delivery of research projects suitable for undergraduate students and secondary school teachers. Projects include modeling electrical charge transport in quantum dot structures, characterizing the performance of novel fuel cells, improving wind turbine designs, investigating hydrogen gas storage techniques, developing low cost but highly efficient thin film solar cells, and synthesizing lithium ion batteries. In addition to their research pursuits, participants will be immersed in experiential education activities that include field trips, hands-on laboratory tours, professional development sessions, and weekly technical seminars with renewable energy themes. At the end of the summer, all participants will share their results at a formal scientific Poster Session with participants from neighboring research programs. Students who produce significant research results will be encouraged to publish their work in scientific journals and/or present their studies at scientific conferences. The teacher will share his or her results with district teachers at the Colorado Science Conference for Professional Development held each November in downtown Denver or at a National Science Teachers Association conference.</AbstractNarration>
