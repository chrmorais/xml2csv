    <AbstractNarration>The OpenFlow (OF) protocol is evolving as a standard in the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm. While high performance networking equipment with OF support is available, continued evolution of the standard means that users may need to augment the functions available in deployed equipment. This augmentation may be performed by network processing units (NPU), or by PC-based solutions. While the network provisioning algorithms for the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) are able to set up OF circuits, they do not currently have the capability of inserting NPUs or other means of function augmentation. This project provides a framework for delivering advanced network functions using NPUs and specifically shows how to use the Cavium network processing unit in ExoGENI racks to provide advanced processing functions at high speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide hooks for enabling the continued use of older OF switches in the face of continued evolution of the OF standard by allowing newer functions to be implemented on NPUs.</AbstractNarration>
