    <AbstractNarration>The mathematical conference "Singular Landscapes" will be held from June 22 - June 26, 2015 in Aussois, France, in a conference center of the French government's national center for scientific research, CNRS. The conference will explore recent progress in singularity theory and its application to diverse areas of mathematics. There will be a special half day on interactions of singularity theory and neuroscience. It is expected that there will be between 90 and 100 (international) participants. The conference will allow participants to establish new working relationships with leaders in this area, and to develop ongoing collaborations. NSF will provide significant travel and lodging support for 12 - 15 U.S.-based participants to the conference. The emphasis on the funding will be towards students, postdoctoral scholars, and participants who do not have other federal support. More information can be found on the conference web site: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/internalPage.py?pageId=3&amp;confId=202 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Singularity theory has recently been applied in many different areas of mathematics, and the talks in the conference will provide an overview of this progress. The meeting will provide an opportunity for researchers from diverse fields to interact and establish research connections with each other; in particular, the participants will benefit from this interaction and from seeing recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas. The primary impacts of the conference will be its dissemination of recent ideas on an important topic -- Singularity Theory -- and the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants. The international makeup of the participants to this meeting and its interdisciplinary focus will be particularly effective at enabling productive collaborative relationships. The encouragement and mentoring from the conference will significantly contribute to the success and professional development of early career mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>
