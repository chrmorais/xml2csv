    <AbstractNarration>The electric power grid is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) that forms the lifeline of modern society. Cybersecurity and resiliency of the power grid is of paramount importance to national security and economic well-being. CPS security testbeds are enabling technologies that provide realistic experimental platforms for the evaluation and validation of security technologies within controlled environments, and they also enable the exploration of robust security solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two objectives: (a) to develop innovative architectures, abstractions, models, and algorithms for large-scale CPS security testbeds; and (b) to design and implement a high-fidelity, scalable, open-access CPS security testbed for the smart grid, and to conduct research experimentation. The testbed integrates appropriate cyber-control-physical hardware/software components, models, and algorithms in a modular design that enables federation of smaller testbeds to form a large-scale virtual experimental environment. The use cases for the testbed include vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, risk mitigation studies, and attack-defense exercises. The project also aims to develop standardized datasets, models, libraries, and use cases, and make the testbed available to a broader research community through an open-, remote-access model by leveraging collaboration from academic and industry partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides contributing to research and technology that will enable a future electric power grid that is secure and resilient, this project develops and disseminates innovative curriculum modules including CPS Cyber Defense Competitions (CPS-CDC) for imparting security knowledge to students via an inquiry-based learning paradigm. The project also mentors students, including underrepresented minorities, in thesis work and Capstone projects, and exposes high-school students to cybersecurity concepts via testbed demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>
